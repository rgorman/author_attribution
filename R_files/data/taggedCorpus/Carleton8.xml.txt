THE/DT DEAD/NNP BOXER./NNP By/IN William/NNP Carleton/NNP CHAPTER/NNP I./NNP One/CD evening/NN in/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT eighteenth/JJ century--as/NN nearly/RB as/IN we/PRP can/MD

this;/IN his/PRP$ step/NN was/VBD slow,/JJR like/IN that/DT of/IN a/DT man/NN who,/, without/IN being/VBG capable/JJ of/IN tracing/VBG those/DT sources/NNS of/IN enjoyment/NN which/WDT the/DT
