		<bibl>James McHenry. The Wilderness; or Braddock's Times. A Tale of the West, Volume 2. New York, New York: E. Bliss and E. White, 1823
                
                <note type="abstract">Voume II of The Wilderness opens with Charles leading the English forces of the army against the French.  His army is much smaller and weaker than the French army, and although the English defenses try their best to fend off the French, they are eventually surrounded and taken over.  Charles has become wounded during this time and is kept in the now French camp for a time to allow his wounds to heal in the most hospitable accommodationspossible.  When Charles is finally healed enough to be transferred to a camp the French attempt to do so and in transit are ambushed and Charles escapes.Charles continues to serve under Washington, whom he respects as a great soldier.  During one ferocious battle, Charles is captured by the Indians, who separate him from the rest of his troops.  Meanwhile, De Villiers has placed Maria Frazier under custody, giving her a choice of marrying him or allowing the death of a dozen English soldiers.  With the help of Tonnaleuka, Washington comes to rescue her.  Upon finding out that Maria is in fact promised to Charles, Washington turns his attention toward rescuing Charles from the Indians and the French.  When the two are finally united, they discover that Tonnaleuka is not an Indian chief, but "a Scotchman, and a Highlander," who is Maria's true father.</note>

<p>The warning which Tonnaleuka had given  Charles to be circumspect in regard to the enemy,  was not lost upon him. He employed Paddy  Frazier as a scout to hover round the French station  at Le Boeuf in order to watch their motions  and give him the earliest intelligence of their  design. He also kept four or five of his men  constantly employed in ranging on horseback,  those quarters of the country from which he could  be suddenly attacked, while the whole of the remainder  were busily engaged in digging trenches,  and preparing long pointed stakes to fix in the  ground to form their stoccade fortification. From  the friendly Indians he at first rceived considerable  aid in forwarding his works; but in a few  days he began to perceive their ardour in his behalf  to diminish; and suspecting that they had  imbided some unfriendly feeling towards him, he<pb n="4"/> thought proper to visit king Shingiss, and expostulate  with him on the subject.</p>

<p>His Delaware Majesty stated to him, that he  still preferred his nation to the French, but as he  was now imitating their conduct by building strong  holds in the country, many of his people began to  fear that these might, some day, be used against  them, instead of the common enemy.</p>

<p>Charles assured him that his strength never  would be employed against his friends; but that  such of the tribes as remained true to him should  always experience his gratitude; and if his nation  should wax strong in the country, which he doubted  not, it would during the next summer, so as to  overmatch the French, those, who now adhered  to him in his weakness, would be amply compensated  and protected from their enemies.</p>

<p>The result of this interview was, that Shingiss  promised to remonstrate with his people, and exhort  them to befriend and assist the English as  usual. They became in consequence somewhat  more carnest in the aid they afforded, and by their  assistance, in about five weeks after Charles's arrival,  the trench was dug, and piles planted around  the two most exposed sides of the intended fort.  The other two sides being skirted by the rivers,  did not require a trench, and the piles for their  circumvallation were getting ready with all possible  despatch.</p>

<p>Matters were thus situated with our adventurers,  when Paddy Frazier arrived in haste one  evening with intelligence, that a large body of  French, consisting, as he conjectured, of between  four and five hundred men, collected from various  forts, were proceeding rapidly down the course  of the Alleghany river, to attack them.</p>

<p>This intelligence was indeed alarming, as their  defences were as yet but slight, and the few<pb n="5"/> Indians who were present, were of very doubtful  fidelity. Charles, however, determined to put a  bold face on the matter, and resist his enemies as  long as he could, with little hope indeed of victory,  but with the expectation of forcing them, if  he must capitulate, to grant him honourable terms.  He despatched a messenger to Shingiss, requesting  the aid of the Delaware warriors. Shingiss  attended personally with about thirty men, being  all he could muster on the emergency. When he  arrived, he addressed Charles---</p>

<quote rend="Shingiss"><p>"You suspected me, brother," said he, "of  want of fidelity to your interests. Brother, I promised  you my assistance in your need---you now  shall have it, for I never broke my word. You will  never tell your great king of the east, that Shingiss  was a deceiver, because I expect you will tell  truth."</p>

<p>"Brother, I have reasoned thus: I will join the  English now, because I am pledged to it. The  French are more powerful and will beat us---but  then we will only be beaten, as brave men often  are---we shall not have broken our words like  cheats and cowards."</p>

<p>"Now, brother---I am ready to obey you."</p>
</quote>

<p>All Charles's force was now concentrated within  the entrenchments; and every man was in full  expectation of a speedy and severe conflict. They  kept all night on the alert one half only retiring  to rest at the time. During the night, however,  they were left undisturbed; but the morning  scarcely dawned when they perceived the woods  at the distance of little more than five hundred  yards, glittering with the arms and uniforms of the  French soldiers.</p>

<p>In a short time, a man approached with a white  flag, who was admitted into the entrenchments.  He said he was sent to demand from Mr.<pb n="6"/> Adderly an absolute surrender of himself, and all the  men and stores under his command to Monsieur  St. Pierre, the officer commanding the troops of his  most Christian Majesty at Le Boeuf, in return for  which his own life, and the lives of all his followers,  should be protected from the power of the  Indians, although they must submit to be sent to  Canada, perhaps to France, as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Charles at once rejected these terms. "If we  were absolutely beaten, thought he, they could  not ask for a submission more disgraceful. In the  name of God and our country, we will try them.  If we beat them off, it is well. If not, it is only to  submit when we can do no better."</p>

<p>His refusal was scarcely communicated to the  French commander, when the trumpets sounded,  and the attack commenced by a heavy fire of  musketry opening upon the English, from which  their defences were so incomplete as to afford them  but a very imperfect shelter. They fought, however,  with great bravery, returning the fire of their  enemies with such promptitude and steadiness,  that they dared not advance to storm the works,  as was their first intention.</p>

<p>Neither party had any cannon, as the French  understanding that the English had none, did not  choose to spend time in transporting any over such  a difficult country as lay between Le Boeuf and  Shanapins, lest the British might become too well  fortified before they attacked them. The whole  of this forenoon was, therefore, spent in the interchange  of a severe and unintermitting fire of musketry,  very destructive to both sides. The French,  it is true, saved themselves as much as they could  behind trees, which afforded them almost as secure  a shelter as the unfinished stoccade did the English.  Their numbers, however, and the necessity  they were under of making frequent<pb n="7"/> movements, rendered them more exposed than the English.  They had, therefore, considerably the  worst of it during this period of attack.</p>

<p>Monsieur St. Pierre, therefore, about one o'clock  in the afternoon, resolved to change the mode of  combat. He accordingly drew off his men from  the reach of the English fire, and dividing them  into two parties, ordered Captain Joncaire to proceed  with one of them out of view of the enemy,  towards the Monongahela, and under cover of its  high bank, which varied in height from twenty to  thirty feet above the common surface of the river,  to proceed down, by the water's edge, to the  point at the junction of the two rivers where the  English station was yet unprotected. He took  himself the charge of the other division which he  conducted, in a similar manner, under shelter of  the Alleghany bank. It was calculated that both  divisions would reach, nearly at one time, the defenceless  quarters of the English position. If not,  however, as either party considerably out-numbered  the force to be attacked, the one which arrived  first, was to lose no time in waiting for the  other, since it could not be far off with its assistance.</p>

<p>St. Pierre's own division came first to the attack,  but on scaling the bank which was considerably  steep, nearly thirty of his men were killed by a  well-directed fire from the English, and the rest  shrunk back under cover of the bank. Another  minute, however, brought forward Joncaire's division,  who made good their destination, not, indeed  without some loss, which, however, they severely  repaid by a dreadful volley upon Charles's men,  who were now without shelter. That instant St.  Pierre's men also leaped upon the contested  ground; and Charles, seeing that further resistance  would only bring useless destruction upon <pb n="8"/>his followers, submitted to necessity, and surrendered  himself and his party prisoners of war.</p>

<p>In this second disastrous conflict which Charles  had conducted against the enemies of his country,  he lost nealy half his men. Five or six  others were wounded, and he himself had one of  his thighs slightly injured by a musket ball. Of  his Indian auxiliaries, ten or twelve, among whom  he particularly regretted king Shingiss, were killed.  The French had between forty and fifty  slain, and nearly as many wounded; but their victory  was decisive, and the object of their expedition  completely attained.</p>

<p>The French commander now resolved to keep  possession of the ground he had taken, both as  furthering the views of his government in extending  their line of forts from Quebec to New Orleans,  and as being the most eligible position  from which he could not only overawe the English  Indians, but check any future attempts that  the Ohio Company, or even the British nation,  might make upon this country.</p>

<p>He immediately set his men to work, assisted by  a great number of Indians, to finish the fort which  the English had begun. During the ensuing  spring, this post assumed a very formidable aspect,  under the name of Fort Du Quesne, overawing  any of the Indian tribes that might still harbour a  secret partially for the English, and for several  years setting even the whole power of the British  in America, at defiance.</p>

<p>St. Pierre, at once, perceived the advantage  of ingratiating himself with the neighbouring tribes,  and drawing them off from the English interest.  He therefore set all the Delawares, whom he had  made prisoners in the late battle, at liberty, and  king Shingiss being now dead, he had no difficulty  in forming an alliance with his successor.</p>

<pb n="9"/> 

<p>Not having accommodations for the English  prisoners at Du Quesne, he in a few days after  the battle, sent the greater number of them under  a strong escort, to Le Boeuf. But Charles was  detained until his wound should be so far healed  as to permit him to travel without inconvenience.  He was kindly enough treated by the French  commander, who permited him to retain all his  private baggage, and afforded him every accommodation  for his personal comfort, that the circumstances  of the place could afford.</p>

<p>Charles bore his misfortunes stoutly, for his conscience  told him that he had done all that man could  do, to avoid them. His employers had not furnished  him with sufficient force to effect their designs,  and hence they failed, and failed too, without  occasioning any great disappointment to his  anticipations. But he did not blame the company.  They had given him all the force they could  muster for such an enterprise, and his own anxiety  to have business once more in the vicinity of  his Maria, together with an ill-judged notion that  the inclemency of the season might protect him  until he should be fortified, and receive additional  succours from the eastward, had induced him to  accept its command.</p>

<p>The state of Maria's mind, on hearing of his  defeat, he had found means to ascertain from Tonnaleuka,  who visited him a day or two after the  battle.</p>

<p>The prophet informed him, "that on first hearing  that the French were about to attack him with  an overwhelming force, she, and indeed the whole  of the Frazier family, manifested great agitation  and alarm for his safety; but as soon as it was  understood that he had escaped with life, she became  resigned and thankful; for she knew that  to be a prisoner of war in the hands of<pb n="10"/> Europeans, although it might be a disagreeable and troublesome,  yet it was not a dangerous, nor could it  be a permanent matter. She, therefore, consoled  herself with the hope that all might yet be  well.</p>

<p>The French commander knew nothing about  Charles's intimacy with the Frazier family, nor  even of their partiality for the English interest.  He knew them indeed to be British subjects, for  he had often heard of them; but he had also heard  of their long residence in the Wilderness, and of  their peaceable demeanor; and he conceived that  from long association with the Indians, they must  have thrown off much of their European manners  and partialities. It did not appear that they  had, in any manner, assisted the English in  their late attempts to gain a footing in the country,  farther than by entertaining some of their  sojourners, and trading with them, which they  were in the habit of doing with individuals of  every nation who visited them. As to Paddy's  agency in behalf of Charles's cause, it was conducted  by that wily woodsman, with so much  adroitness and secresy, that no one in the French  interest suspected him. He was, therefore, without  hindrance, permitted to trade at their forts,  with which he continued to maintain as free and  uncontroled an intercourse, as before these transactions.</p>   

<p>As to Tonnaleuka, although the French commandant  had too much of the philosophical scepticism  of his countrymen in his disposition, to  place much confidence in his prophetical pretensions,  yet he respected him as a man of extraordinary  talents and information, and courted his  friendship and good will with considerable assiduity,  on account of the great influence that he knew  him to possess over the native tribes. The<pb n="11"/> prophet was therefore under no restraint in his intercourse  with the different forts; and consequently,  very few matters of importance were agitated,  either there, or in any of the Indian councils, with  which he was not acquainted.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, Charles Adderly being quite  recovered of his wound, Monsieur St. Pierre  thought proper to send him under a guard of six  soldiers, to his fellow prisoners at Le Boeuf. This  was a movement very much against Charles's inclination.  He wished to remain as near as possible  to the residence of Maria; and he had  during his confinement consoled himself with  the hope of obtaining permission, on his parole,  to occasionally visit Frazier's family. He  had, however, to submit to the will of his conqueror;  and he departed from Du Quesne in company  with his guard, with a heavy and reluctant  heart, about the beginning of February, 1754.</p>

<p>The weather was cold and dry, with about two  feet depth of snow on the ground; but the party  were hardy and lively, and tolerably well equipped  for the journey. They proceeded on merrily  and carelessly, for nearly two days, without meeting  with any accident; but on the evening of the  second, when they reached the bank of Bear  Creek, between thirty and forty miles from Du  Quesne, their progress was unexpectedly arrested  by a volley of musketry fired by men in ambush,  which killed four of the guard upon the  spot. The assailants immediately leaped from  their concealment, with loud cheers; and to  Charles's infinite surprise and delight, he beheld  his friends Paddy and Archy Frazier, Peter M`  Fall and Dr. Killbreath. Paddy, the Doctor, and  Archy, threw away their rifles, and seizing each  a loaded musket from the fallen Frenchmen, gave<pb n="12"/> instant chace to the two survivers, who, the moment  their companions fell, had taken to flight,  without thinking of Charles, or waiting to see  whether they were attacked by Indians or  white men. But Peter ran directly to loosen the  cords that bound his master's wrists; Charles,  however, ordered him first to call his companions  back from the pursuit, saying, "there has already  been slaughter enough here. It will now do no  harm to allow these two poor fellows to escape."</p>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Arrah! Master, now, my honey, never mind  them," said Peter. "Who knows but they might  come and fire a backshot at us, before we could  get home; and then the devil take us, if the  chance wouldn't be that some of us wouldn't get  home at all, at all. By the piper, Doran! who  broke the hangman's neck at the foot of the gallows,  master, but our boys must send lead into their  wheezans."</p>
            </quote>

<p>By this time, however, Charles was loose, and  he hastened himself after the pursuers, whom he  was easily able to trace, by their tracks in the  snow. He had not run far, until he heard two  or three shots fired, and again loud cheers rang  in the air. He soon arrived at the spot, and found  to his unspeakable chagrin, that the objects of his  solicitude had received their death wounds.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"My friends---I heartily thank you for the service  you have rendered me," said he. "But  would it not have been as well to have spared  these poor men! Was not your object fully enough  accomplished before their destruction?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"No, sir," replied Paddy Frazier. "When I  manage a thing, it shall never be half done, or  else the devil is in it. Our object was, no doubt,  to rescue you at all risks, but it was also, to do it  without any risk, if we could. And do you think<pb n="13"/> that there would be no risk in permitting these  men to escape? If we did not pursue them to  death, they might have pursued us, by our tracks  in the snow, to discovery; which might one day  have terminated in the destruction of at least some  of us; perhaps of your humble servant, my precious  self, who knows! for it as certain as that  snow lies there, that they would have discovered  and told our names to our good friends, their  complaisant countrymen. Nay, they might have  taken a more speedy revenge, by sending, from  some convenient place, a couple of balls after us,  one of which might have lodged in my own  groin, where, Mr. Adderly, I assure you I would  have conceived it no agreeable guest. In short,  sir, by shooting them, I breathe easier, and am  likely to breathe longer."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"There may be some truth in your observations,"  returned Charles; "and as the deed is now  done, it will do no good to argue its propriety.  Let me again assure you of my gratitude for your  exertions in my behalf. I only wish that the affair  could have been managed with less bloodshed---  but that may have been impossible."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Arrah, master!" cried Peter McFall, "it has  been done snugly. I knew Paddy was the boy  could manage it. Och! long life to his mother  that put such an eye in his head when she bore  him. By the great Brian! master, if he couldn't,  at half a mile's distance, shoot your nose off without  touching your face!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Why Peter, now when I think of it," exclaimed  Charles, "how, in the name of wonder,  are you here? I thought you had been quietly  lodged in Le Boeuf long since."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Arrah! master, now be asy," said Peter,  winking significantly; "can't you keep a bit of a<pb n="14"/> secret; sure I told you before that there are more  ways of getting out of Le Boeuf than by the door."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"What! then I suppose you escaped through  the kennel again!" said Charles.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"No, your honour. By my sowl, the devil  couldn't now escape that way," replied Peter; "it  is now a wooden pipe, that you could scarcely put  your fist in. But I scaled the walls, may it please  your honour, like a lark, and swung down the  tother side like a swallow, and so bade them adieu,  to eat their own meal and potatoes; though the  devil a morsel of oatmeal or a good Irish potato  did Peter ever see among them, my honey!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>In short, by dint of patience and interrogatories,  Charles ascertained that Peter, finding from an  alteration in the structure of the drain which had  been before so propitious to him, that he could do  no good by its means, resolved to discover some  other. He for several days prosecuted his investigations,  and exercised his ingenuity to no purpose.  But he was resolved not to be baffled in  his design. Escape he must, he had repeatedly  sworn to himself, if he should some night blow out  the sentinel's brains in order to effect it. This  would be a rather dangerous scheme, he thought,  and therefore, after long balancing on the subject,  he preferred one which only presented him with  the trifling hazard of beaking his neck.</p>

<p>He had taken notice of a long line of jack-cord,  which reached from the top of one of the piles of  the stoccade to an iron staple fixed in the gable  of one of the store-houses. This line had been  placed there for the purpose of airing and drying  the clothes of the garrison. This cord, partly  from its smallness, and partly from long exposure  to the weather, had become rather weak to bear  the weight of such a man as Peter; but he instantly  conceived that if it were doubled, it might<pb n="15"/> answer the use he intended. In order to ascertain  this, he took an opportunity, when he was unobserved,  of relieving its end from the staple, and  having doubled it, he found it, after repeatedly  trying his weight upon it, quite sufficient for his  purpose. He again secured it in the staple, until  night should give him an opportunity of commencing  his operations; and in the interval searched  for and found a large iron hook, to the one end  of which, when the hour was favourable for his  design, he attached the cord, and by repeatedly  throwing it up to the top of the stoccade, he at last  dexterously fixed it upon the pile round which the  other end of the cord was bound. He now, by a  great effort of strength, slung over the piles a small  bag of provisions, and then, with the agility of a  cat, ascended to the top of the stoccade, from which  he at first intended to let himself drop down. But  the height was too fearful. He, therefore, drew  over his cord, and fixing the hook more firmly  than when he ascended, he committed his safety  to it, and in a few moments reached the ground on  the outside, without injury. Then shouldering his  bag of provisions, he whistled adien to Le Boeuf,  and in about a week found himself seated by Gilbert  Frazier's fireside. Hence it was that Paddy,  who projected and conducted the scheme of  Charles's rescue, obtained him as a bold and zealous  auxiliary.</p>

</lg>

<p>A short time brought Charles to the residence  of his beloved. Oh! how comfortable, how happy  he now felt as he sat by her side and gazed  upon her charms. Here he beheld himself so  suddenly, so unexpectedly, freed from the midst  of his misfortunes, and placed in that very spot  where of all the world he most wished to be, and  in the presence of her whose society alone could  yield him true happiness, that the whole almost  appeared to him as if it had been the effect of magic.  What luxury on earth was equal to this!  what could he wish for more! The bliss of  "pleasure after pain" he now enjoyed for a few  days almost to intoxication; for in the romance  of his feelings, in the intensity of his joy, his gratitude,  and his love, he buried every recollection of  past pain, except such as served to make present  enjoyment sweeter; and as to any anticipations of  future evil, they could no more gain his attention  than a true-bred Yankee could forget charging  for <emph>value delivered</emph>.</p>

<pb n="17"/>

<p>But Maria did not feel so perfectly at ease.  Rejoiced as she was at his escape from his enemies,  she greatly feared his falling again into their  hands, for she knew that under present circumstances  he could not in the Wilderness enjoy that  perfect safety she wished for him. His enemies  she believed would soon hear or suspect something  of his rescue, and would no doubt use all  their powerful endeavours to discover the place  of his concealment. She endeavoured to impress  these truths upon her lover's mind, but he, for the  first two or three days, would give toleration to no  feeling that possessed the remotest appearance of  being a drawback upon his present enjoyment.</p>

<p>At length his enthusiasm of delight began somewhat  to subside; or, to speak more correctly, to  become reasonable; and she succeeded in convincing  him that his only security against being  retaken by his enemies, would be close concealment,  or else flight from the Wilderness. The  latter expedient she acknowledged was, at this  season of the year, rather difficult and dangerous.  The weather was inclement, and he might perish  in a storm; or, as the mountains were covered  with snow, an attempt to cross them might lead  to his discovery, by exposing the tracks of his  footsteps to the enemy.</p>

<p>Removal from the vicinity of his Maria was,  indeed, at this time a disagreeable step, which  Charles was happy to have some reasonable excuse  for avoiding.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"My love," said he, "banish me not from your  presence, and I will adopt any other means of security---  I will conceal myself in any other manner  you may prescribe."</p></quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You are aware," said she, "that as soon as  the French suspect your escape, they will search  for you here. They will naturally suppose that,<pb n="18"/> if you be at all in the Wilderness, your countrymen  will know something of you. I wish you to  disguise deeply, remove to some distance from  us, and visit us but seldom, at least until the heat  of the pursuit after you shall abate. Tonnaleuka  will furnish you with a retreat, for he knows all  the fastnesses and lurking places of the forest. Our  family will take care to supply you with every  thing they can to render your asylum comfortable."</p>
</quote>   

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Oh, Maria! this is almost banishment," he  replied; "it will drive me to some solitary shade  where I will be deprived of your presence."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"But it is necessary, in your present circumstances,"  said she, "to submit to this inconvenience,  unless you wish to be again captured;  and the sooner you submit, my Charles, I will  feel the sooner at ease in regard to your safety."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"O Maria! speak ever thus to me, and I will  do any thing you wish. But, bethink you, my  sweetest maiden, there is not, there cannot be,  much danger of my being here searched for so  very soon as you apprehend. There is not one  of my escort now living to tell the story of my  rescue. It will be many days before any suspicion  of it takes place at Le Boeuf, and many more  before that suspicion is communicated to Du  Quesne. Even then, the enemy will not be certain  whether the whole party may not have perished,  either by intense cold, or by some marauding  band of treacherous Indians. In short, my  too timid love, I do not believe that the pursuit  after me will be either very eager, or of long continuance."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It may turn out as you say," replied Maria;  "but it may also turn out otherwise. This is the  danger; and to guard against misfortune upon  which we can calculate, however remote may be<pb n="19"/> its appearance, is surely wise and prudent. O  Charles! be prudent, for both our sakes. O! relieve  my mind, and without delay betake yourself  to disguise and concealment."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I shall do as you wish," said he. "For your  sake I will dive into the thickest of the woods,  into the depths of caverns, for concealment. Only  let your mind be at ease, I will vanish from danger,  although in doing so, I shall be banished  from you. I will attend Tonnaleuka wherever he  chooses to lead me."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Now I am satisfied, Charles," said she; "all  will be well. Under the prophet's care you will  be safe. He will be here this night, and shall direct  your proceedings."</p>
            </quote>

<p>That evening Tonnaleuka, as Maria had foretold,  visited them.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said he to Charles, "you are once  more out of the power of your enemies, and it  only now requires prudence to keep you so. My  son, I rejoice that this maiden has prevailed on you  to follow my directions. If you be ready, follow  me---but first bid that maiden farewell, for you  will not see her for many weeks."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Oh, father!" he cried, "what do you require  of me! Why separate us long? What necessity  is there---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said Tonnaleuka, "I have promised  to her, that if you obey my directions, I will  be responsible for your safety; and I will not endanger  my word by exposing it to risk. Your  obedience will be voluntary; but if, by following  your inclinations, you bring evil upon yourself,  then I shall be blameless. Now, my son, choose  whether you shall be ruled by me, or by your own  imprudent wishes."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles looked at Maria with an expression  which asked, "shall I go?"</p>

<pb n="20"/>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Mr. Adderly," said she, "this hesitation is  unbecoming, it is weak. Haste, attend the prophet,  if you regard my peace of mind, or your  own absolute security. Alas, Charles! since you  will have me to express myself so, I feel every  hour an age, till I know that you are beyond the  reach of your enemies."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I go, dearest of maidens! and I promise to  obey the prophet. But, O! let me ask one request.  If there be danger in my coming to thee,  surely there can be none in thy visiting me. Will  the distance not be too far to allow me sometimes  to see thee in my concealment?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It may happen that I will visit you," she replied.  "But if I should not, you may assure yourself that  it will only be lest my going might excite suspicion  of your retreat. Farewell then!---be patient, and  submit to temporary inconveniences. The prophet  is your friend, and O! may God be so too!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Farewell!" he said; and he pressed her hand  to his burning lips, and followed Tonnaleuka out  of the apartment.</p>
            </quote>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight frosty night. Ten  thousand fiery stars sparkled in the heavens, and  the pure cold snow glittered on the earth. The  queen of night coursed, in all her splendour, steadily  and majestically along the smooth blue starstudded  arch that overcanopied the sober and chequered  horizon of mountains and vales, clothed in  a party-coloured covering of dark trees, and silvery  shining snow that lay extended beneath. The  rivers and rivulets were all frozen as hard as iron,  and the movements of every terrestrial object  seemed to be arrested, except the shadows of  trees, and rocks, and mountains, which flitted  around as Charles and his conductor went forward,  as if to yield them way, or pay them respect as  they passed by.</p>

<pb n="21"/>

<p>Tonnaleuka led the way, and Charles followed  in meditative silence. They kept nearly northward,  along the right bank of Turtle Creek. The  stream soon became enclosed between high mountains,  and they crossed on the ice to its left bank,  along which they proceeded about half a mile; when  suddenly taking a path that led in an easterly direction  up a high hill, on gaining its top, they kept  along the ridge which it formed, still in an easterly  course, for half a mile further. They then struck  suddenly to the left, and descended into a deep  valley, at the bottom of which they crossed a small  run, near a place where it was almost overarched  by a huge rock, which formed the rugged juttying  face of the opposing ridge. They passed up the  bank of this stream underneath this fearful arch,  to which the solemn rays of the moon now imparted  an aspect impressively awful, for about two  hundred yards, to a place where the continuity of  the rock became interrupted by a deep ravine,  into which they turned. For a few moments they  ascended a small path, until about half way up the  left side of this ravine, when they came to a large  rock, which seemed to obstruct their farther progress.</p>   

<p>Here the prophet spoke to Charles for the first  time since they had left Frazier's.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Now, my son," said he, "you will see my favourite  retreat when I wish for concealment.  There are only two individuals, besides myself,  who know it, and in these I can repose implicit  reliance. You will be the third; consequently the  confidence I have in you cannot be small; and the  security you will here enjoy from either French or  Indians, will be as great as even your Maria could  desire. Within is the lodging I am about to afford  you, till you can leave the Wilderness in safety.<pb n="22"/> its entrance, except by those who already know  it, can only be found by a miracle."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, Tonnaleuka caught hold of a branch  of a small pine tree, that seemed to be growing in  the angle formed by the rock and the side of the  acclivity, and pulling it downward, he separated  the upper side of the root some distance from the  earth. He let go his hold, and the tree remained  in this posture.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Follow me!" said Tonnaleuka, as he ascended  to the gap, which this separation of the tree  from the earth had occasioned, into which he lowered  himself by a flight of ten or twelve rugged  stone steps, until he came to a kind of landing-place,  or lobby, having a smooth earthen bottom.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Remain here a few moments, until I strike a  light," said Tonnaleuka, and he proceeded into a  dark passage, in what direction Charles could not  tell, but of considerable length he conjectured,  from the distance at which he soon heard the  sound of his retiring footsteps, while he himself  remained awkwardly enough watching the oblique  rays of the moon, that with great effort cast down  a very feeble light to where he stood. In a short  time, however, he perceived the glancing of light  at a distance in the subterraneous passage, and  Tonnaleuka soon returned with a flaming taper.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said he, when he approached, "draw  the rope which winds through that pulley."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles did so, and the root of the tree instantly  returning to its place, closed up the aperture by  which they had entered, and the rays of the moon  were no longer visible.</p>

<p>The prophet now led the way through a long,  narrow, and rather damp passage, which at length  brought them into a large, dry, and airy chamber,  with a comfortable floor somewhat more elevated<pb n="23"/> than the passage. In an angle of this apartment,  to the left of its entrance, the embers of a woodfire  not quite extinguished were seen, on a convenient  hearth, which possessed a species of funnel  that carried away the smoke by an outlet, which  Charles afterwards discovered to be into another  ravine, on the opposite side of the ridge from that  on which they had entered.</p>

<p>The furniture was simple and scanty, comprising  no articles but such as were of prime necessity  for the comfort of one, or, at most, of two individuals.  There was indeed a bed and bedding,  not much inferior to some of those possessed by  Gilbert Frazier. A plain table, two or three  chairs, a small stool, a large chest, a cupboard, two  or three shelves, with scarcely any cooking utensils,  constituted the remainder of what Charles  Adderly now observed in this subterranean hermitage.</p>   

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Sit down, my son," said Tonnaleuka; "you  are now in my abode. I must warm it. The  cheering flame shall blaze forth in a few minutes."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He withdrew into the passage, but soon returned  with several billets of wood in his arm, which,  to the great comfort and exhilaration of Charles,  who had begun to feel rather discontented, chilly,  and vapourish with his situation, soon began to  crackle from the impulse of the glowing element,  and to enliven the chamber with its animating  rays.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, you perhaps need refreshment," said  the prophet. "I shall supply you---for within this  cavern there is enough for all present wants."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Father, I require none," said Charles, "but  I acknowledge that I need repose, for my mind is  overpowered with sadness."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"And what grieve you for?" asked the prophet---  "Is it because you are not now a prisoner in Le<pb n="24"/> Boeuf or Du Quesne? Or is it because you are not  now in Gilbert Frazier's, exposed to the risk of being  again captured and exposed to the vengeance of  your enemies? Are you sad, my son, because you  are safe? If so, you are here without restraint,  and may rush again into danger, if it will give you  pleasure."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"But, my son, you have promised to be ruled by  me, and it is the wish of her whom you love that  you should be so. Will you vex her by your imprudence,  by your breach of word? Know you  not, that your enemies are powerful and numerous  in the country; and if you should fall again  into their hands, think you, that they would treat  you with indulgence? No, my son---be wise, render  yourself content here for a few weeks. You  will want for nothing necessary to human life.  Food, drink, a bed to lie on, and books to read,  you shall have as liberally as the Wilderness can  afford. But for your own sake, and for the sake  of one still more beloved, I request you to reconcile  yourself to a temporary privation of her society,  and of the external world."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, I offer you food---I wish you to partake  of it; but if you prefer retiring to rest, go,  and may the blessing of the Great Father accompany  you!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles preferred retiring, and requested the  prophet to excuse his apparent dissatisfaction with  his residence, as he in reality felt both mind and  body overcast and indisposed. To-morrow, he  hoped, he should recover the serenity of his mind,  and be able to express, with cheerfulness and cordiality,  the obligations he owed him as his kind  deliverer.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Talk not of obligations, my son," said the  prophet. "My duties are my obligations, and for  performing them, I require no thanks. Ah! my <pb n="25"/> son, how miserable I should have long felt a life,  whose misfortunes have been severer than any you  have yet experienced, had it not been, that among  my red brethren I have often found the means of  doing good! But your mind is oppressed. Repose,  I hope, will relieve you. I will show you  where to seek it."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He took up the light, and conducting Charles  a few yards into the passage through which they  had before passed, turned to the right into a small  recess, much more comfortable and clean in its  appearance than the large apartment. Here he  beheld a bed prepared for his reception, with a  small table and a chair, both exhibiting very rude  workmanship, but suitable enough for the place,  and the purposes intended by them.</p>

<p>The prophet having pronounced a short benediction  upon his guest, retired, and Charles was  about throwing himself into bed, when he perceived,  beneath the bedclothes, a letter addressed to  himself. He opened it, and seeing that it was  from Maria, with feelings of great emotion he read  as follows:</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier">
<p>"Dear Charles,</p>
<p>"My persuading you to submit, at this time,  to a residence in a dark subterraneous cell, is a  proof how anxious I am for your safety. You  will, no doubt, feel your situation lonely and disagreeable;  but I hope the necessity for it will not  be of long continuance; and, in the meanwhile,  in order to relieve its tediousness as much as possible,  I shall send you a supply of such books as I  possess, best suited for your entertainment. You  may be also assured, that our family will let you  want for nothing in their power to afford you  comfort."</p>

<pb n="26"/>

<p>"Oh, Charles! how little are the men and women  of society aware of the dangers and calamities  that often visit the most remote and secluded  condition! How have their philosophers and their  poets praised, in strains of enthusaism and rapture,  the virtue, the tranquillity, and the happiness,  to be found in retirement! Ah! they appear  to forget that human passions, and, therefore,  human crimes and human miseries, are ever, in  such places, more violent and fierce, because  more unrestrained and unmodified by the salutary  customs and institutions of society!"</p>

<p>"But, Charles, the object of my writing to you,  is to encourage you to an exertion of patience in  your present solitude, and not to magnify the evils  to which it is exposed, by making contrasts, for  which my inexperience renders me incompetent."</p>

<p>"But these times of calamity, I trust, will not  always last. Providence will yet moderate the  storm, and grant this Wilderness a restoration of  that calm which it once enjoyed. Till then, let  us shelter ourselves, as much as possible, from the  fury of the times, and be content with privations,  if we can only thereby secure safety. I am aware  that this advice will not be relished by your adventurous  spirit; but it is because I dread that  spirit, fearless and rash as I know it to be, leading  you into fresh dangers, that I am so solicitous for  your present confinement. If it will in any degree  enable you to support that confinement, I have  here no hesitation to repeat the assurance, which  you already have, of the unalterable nature of my  affection for you."</p>

<p>"Let me be assured in return, that you will  bear your present lot without repining, and you  will contribute much to my ease of mind;---and,  that heaven may protect you, and hasten over"<pb n="27"/> these times of danger and distress, is the fervent  prayer of your, Maria."</p> 
</quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Yes!" thought Charles, when he had finished  this letter, "I am happy. Ah! what can make  me otherwise, when I possess the affections, the  sweet, the pure, the tender, the faithful affections  of such a lovely being! Oh heaven! it would  indeed, be criminal to repine at thy dispensations,  when thou hast granted me this! This is ample  remuneration for all sufferings---this is balm for  every wound!---O thou good Providence that  hast thus granted me the first wish of my heart,  make me truly grateful for such a consolation,  such a blessing, amidst my misfortunes!---Yes, I  will assure the dear maiden that I will not repine---  I will assure her that I am happy, and that she  has made me so!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>The weight and weariness upon his spirits, of  which he had complained so much to Tonnaleuka,  were now gone; and, instead of anxiously wishing  to relieve his mind of the thoughts that crowded  upon it, he now wished to indulge them, and  to prolong, by a protracted wakefulness, the delightful  sensations which they afforded him.</p>

<p>If he had possessed writing materials, a glowing  reply, as warm as love and gratitude could dictate,  would soon have extended itself, in black  and white, upon the table before him. But this  pleasing spectacle he could not enjoy until the  next morning, without interrupting Tonnaleuka  either in his devotions or his repose, for he reasonably  enough supposed, that by this time the  prophet was engaged in one of these. He had,  therefore, nothing for it but to hurry into bed,  and fall asleep as fast as possible, in order to annihilate  the time that must elapse before he could  enjoy the felicity of pouring out his soul in a letter  to his beloved.</p>

</lg>

<p>Tonnaleuka was surprised in the morning to  see Charles in such good spirits, although he at  once conjectured the cause, for he had himself  been the bearer of Maria's letter, and had deposited  it where it had been found.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"You have benefited much from your night's  repose, I perceive, my son," said the prophet.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Yes, father;" replied Charles, "I am much  better than I was last night. But, father, could  you oblige me with materials for writing?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I can, my son. It will be a pleasant amusement  for you. I am glad you desire it. By reading  and writing, I trust you will be able to spend  your time here without feeling it tedious and uncomfortable."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I shall try to do so, father," replied Charles,  who having possessed himself with pen, ink, and  paper, retired with a light heart to his bed-chamber,  to write his epistle.</p>
            </quote>

<p>I will not insert this elaborate address of the  enamoured Charles to his beloved in these<pb n="29"/> memoirs, because, although it did not contain a sentiment  which was not the sincere dictate of his  heart, and for the sincerity of which Maria did not  give him full credit, yet I am aware that there is  not one reader in twenty but would consider it  absolute bombast. It is, indeed, frequently impossible  for enthusiastic lovers, like Charles, when  communicating by letter to the mistress of their  hearts, the fervours of their passion, to write common  sense, at least what common readers can receive  as such: for, like all other classes and communities  of men, lovers have a technical language  of their own, to themselves the prettiest, and  sweetest, perhaps, of all languages; but certainly  the least rational, and intelligible, to the rest of  the world.</p>

<p>Charles having finished his letter, put it into the  hands of the prophet, who promised that it should  be conveyed to Maria that very day.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"With respect to your servant's safety, my  son," said the prophet, "I have thought it necessary  that something should also be done; for if left  long to himself so near his enemies, his rashness  will inevitably expose him to the risk of being recaptured."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Father," replied Charles, "the certainty of  his safety would indeed give me pleasure, and I  shall be thankful for whatever your wisdom may  think proper to do for him."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"It may be," said the prophet, "that he will  be unwilling to obey my directions. Your authority  may be necessary to induce him thereto.  Write to him that it is your will he should obey  me, and I will provide for his safety. I cannot  bring him here to conceal him, or to receive your  commands, because I wish not the secret of this  cavern to be known to one of his careless and unguarded  disposition."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="30"/>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"You are prudent, father," replied Charles,  "and you are right. I shall write to Peter, that  in obeying you be obeys me, and that on pain of  my displeasure he must attend to your directions."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles wrote accordingly, and shortly afterwards  Tonnaleuka set out on a visit to Frazier's.  In order to prevent any of Charles's enemies from  suspecting, on account of the termination of the  tracks of footsteps in the snow at the pine tree,  that there was any lurking-place near it, he continued  to extend these tracks onwards quite over  the ridge, by now taking a circuitous route to Frazier's.</p>   

<p>Having delivered Maria's letter, he took Paddy  Frazier aside and explained to him his views with  respect to Peter McFall.</p>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"I have myself been a little alarmed on this  subject," observed Paddy, "lest that fellow's long  tongue should some time or other betray to the  French the whole affair of Mr. Adderly's rescue.  His discovering on himself only would be of  little consequence, as the world could jog on  pretty well without him; and besides, you know  it would be altogether his own business---though I  don't wish the blockhead to get into a scrape  either. In short, father, I agree with you that,  for the general good, we must get him out of the  way as soon as possible."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Have you not certain trading concerns at  Gist's plantation, on pretence of managing which  we could send him there?" asked Tonnaleuka.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"It is a good thought, father;" replied Paddy,  "I have a package of otter and minx skins, that  I wish immediately conveyed to Gist's. Father,  I think we can despatch him with them; nay, I  shall go with him every yard myself, and fix matters  so with Gist as to have our loose-tongued  Irishman detained there for a few months at any<pb n="31"/> rate, by which time it may please fortune to turn  up something for our benefit."</p>
            </quote>

<p>This scheme was agreed upon, and Peter was  summoned before Tonnaleuka.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said the prophet, "here is a letter  requiring you to perform some services I have in  view for you. Will you have any objection?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Now, by the powers! prophet," replied Peter,  "isn't that a strange question? don't you see  my master bids me---och! may the blessing of  "Bonna-Margery" be on him! But, prophet,  may I make free to ask you just where you have  stuffed my poor master out of the way? for sure  wouldn't Peter attend to him and all his errands,  if it should be running in and out of the devil's  dungeon, or even a catamount's den in this Wilderness."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I know your regard for your master," observed  the prophet, and hence it is that I am persuaded  you will cheerfully undertake the performance  of an errand on which he wishes you immediately  to proceed. As to your master's present residence,  my son, I am not at liberty to reveal it. But I  may assure you that he is quite comfortable and  safe."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Arrah, now, dear prophet! but you know  every thing. You know where my master is.  Now, if you would only tell me, so that I might  set my eye again on him; who knows---botheration  to it! if we couldn't dash our brains together, and  find out some method---never fear us for that, dear  prophet!---of making our way to swate Philadelphy  again, God bless her! but I wish my master  and myself were once more snug under the wooden  roof of her long beef market, my jewel!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"But, my son," observed Tonnaleuka, "on  your present errand Paddy here will accompany  you, and you will assist him as your master<pb n="32"/> desires, in his trading designs. Will you start tomorrow,  and Paddy will have matters prepared  for your journey?"</p>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"This moment, your honour---if I may call a  prophet, your honour---Och! now, any moment,  I'll obey my master's orders---but where must I  go?"</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Paddy will give you every information," said  Tonnaleuka. "Follow his directions, and expect  my blessing and your master's approbation."</p>

It saved poor Peter a deal of trouble  when he was in Ireland, your reverence; and  if you'll just do the same for me in this wild country,  Och! how I'll skip over it any where your  worship and my master please to send me."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I'll remember you in my orisons," replied the  prophet. "But you must now for some time follow  Paddy's directions." So saying, Tonnaleuka  departed.</p>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Horses horns!" exclaimed Peter, when the  prophet was gone; "horses horns!---he'll remember  me in his horses horns! What the devil  is that, Paddy? If horses have horns in this country,  by the great Columb! but it's more than they  have in Ireland, my boy."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"He said his orisons, which is Indian for saying  mass," returned Paddy. "It is only <emph>asses</emph>   and stags that have horns in this country. But,  Peter, we must be off by sunrise to-morrow.  I have a parcel of peltry and furs you must asassist  me to take to Gist's plantation. It is only  about a hundred miles up the river. Your master  wishes you to remain there, where he<pb n="33"/> intends you shall see him, probably in a couple of  months."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"See him in a couple of months!" exclaimed  Peter. "Why, sure now, he may be in heaven  before that time, and Peter in purgatory, and I  may never see him at all---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Very likely," replied his consoling companion;  "or might it not just as readily happen that  you should both go to purgatory together?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"By my faith," said Peter, "and sure that's  just what I would like. But my master has never  a purgatory to go to. Why, didn't you know he's  a Protestant, my jewel?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"And that will save him from the devil's flail,  you think?" said Paddy. "Don't they say they  thrash poor sinners in that purging hole of yours,  till their sins are beat out of them?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Peter McFall"><p>"Och, Paddy!" cried Peter, "none of your  jeers now---for it's only when we don't pay the  priest well enough to say mass for our souls, heaven  bless them! that the devil thrashes them: but  it's for their good after all, as my mother used to  say."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Well, Peter, it may be so; we'll not dispute  about this matter, just because we know nothing  about it. Only you need not expect to meet your  master at either Gist's or purgatory, for two  months at least. So you must be content to wait  for him at whichever of the two places you first  find yourself. But take care, that in neither place  you mention any thing about our rescuing him  from the French. It will do Gist no good to hear  it, and as to the devil you may meet with in purgatory,  he must know already all about it, from the  clattering of the half dozen Frenchmen we sent  there."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Peter promised to attend to this salutary caution;  and every thing being that evening<pb n="34"/> prepared for their journey, they set forward with the  dawn the next morning for Gist's habitation, where  Paddy left his companion to fall in love with one  of Gist's daughters, which he swore by St. Patrick  he would, if he were obliged to remain there  only the half of the time prescribed to him.---  I have been actually informed that Peter did, in  this instance, literally keep his oath, and permitted  the charms of the fair Esther Gist entirely to  obliterate from his recollection those of Molly  M`Nickle. So much, dear reader, for the constancy  of man!</p>

<p>Paddy returned to his father's, after little more  than a week's absence, with his mind entirely at  ease, as to the present security of both Charles  Adderly and his man Peter from the power of the  French. He had, indeed, in a short time afterwards,  reason to congratulate himself on Peter's  removal; for the French had begun to entertain  some suspicion as to the fate of Charles's escort,  and had employed a number of Indians to range  the whole country in search of information concerning  them. Some of the remains of the French  soldiers were at length found, very much mangled  and torn by wild beasts, but still in a condition to  admit of their being identified. Suspicion was, by  Paddy's sly management, fixed upon some of the  Delaware Indians, who were supposed still to harbour  a secret partiality for Charles Adderly and  the English interest. It was even believed, that  Charles was yet secreted among them. Their  chiefs were in consequence summoned to Fort Du  Quesne, in order to undergo an investigation, and  answer to charges founded on these surmises before  the French commandant.</p>

<p>They attended cheerfully, and replied to all  questions with such promptitude, and freedom  from embarrassment, that St. Pierre, persuaded of<pb n="35"/> their innocence, was about to dismiss them, when  Swanlamis, their king, addressed him:</p>

<quote rend="Swanlamis"><p>"Father! you called us here to answer an accusation  of treachery and murder. Father! we  abhor treachery, and we never slay those with  whom we are at amity. We first return the wampum  of peace, we break the calumet, and we sing  the war-song in public, ere we abrogate treaties.  Have we done these things towards you? It is injurious,  therefore, to say that we killed your people  at the time you were our brothers, and when  we professed friendship for you. Father! it was  wicked in you to suspect us. It shows you could  do such things yourselves, if your occasions required  them."</p>

<p>"Father! you must think better of us, and not  judge of our integrity by your own, if you wish to  preserve our friendship. The English were more  manly than you. They once charged us with  coolness, but never with treachery; for they knew  that before we should injure them we would warn  them, and return their wampum. Shingiss thought  himself bound to them, and he died fighting for  them."</p>

<p>"Father! we will do so for you, if you act generously.  If not, we will remove afar off to the  English lands southward, and lift the hatchet  against you."</p>

<p>"What we want you now to do, father, is, to  tell all the tribes that we are innocent---that we  scorn treachery, and that you are sorry for having  suspected us. We will then forgive your rashness,  and smoke with you as if this matter had not  happened. We can resent vengefully, but we can  also forgive readily. Father, choose ye!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>St. Pierre, partly from motives of policy, and  partly from a sentiment of generosity towards men<pb n="36"/> whose feelings he thought it was but just to soothe  by some concession, replied---</p>

<quote rend="St Pierre"><p>"My brother---that your people have been  wrongfully accused of this deed, I believe. But  the accusation did not originate with me. It has  been circulated by many mouths; and I thought  it was your due to afford you this opportunity, if  you were innocent, to justify yourselves to all  men. I am glad you have been able to do so, and  I hope that every one will be as satisfied as I am."</p>

<p>"Brother---I will inform all our allies that you  are innocent; and, for the trouble I have given  you, I shall order you a present of rum and some  blankets."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The Indians, perfectly satisfied with this result,  left the garrison in great good humour with their  allies.</p>

<p>The search after Charles and Peter M`Fall,  whose escape from Le Boeuf was, soon after it  took place, known at Du Quesne, was carried on  for some time, in the neighbourhood of both forts,  to no purpose. It then slackened, and at length  was altogether abandoned as fruitless; and Maria  began to feel quite at ease in respect to her lover's  security.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>He had written to her often, and in every letter  pressingly solicited a visit from her. "O my love!"  he would say, "let your presence but for once  bless the cell to which you have condemned me---  it will then be endeared to me, and I shall feel  happy!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>At length, as soon as she was assured that all  inquiry after him was relinquished by his enemies,  she yielded to his request, and accompanied the  prophet to his cavern. Charles was sitting beside  a tolerably comfortable fire, with his head reclined  upon the table, meditating upon her when she  entered. The prophet had gone on, as was his<pb n="37"/> usual custom during a time of snow, to continue  the tracks to the other side of the ridge, until they  joined a frequented Indian path about half a mile  distant. She, therefore, entered her lover's apartment  alone, and her light footsteps along the passage  had not aroused him from his meditations.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Mr. Adderly!" said she. He looked up, and  scarcely believing his senses, started to his feet,  and approached her.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah, Maria!" he exclaimed; "blessed girl!  and I indeed so happy! Have you come at last, to  cheer your Charles amidst the solitude of his dungeon?"</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I have ventured" said she, "with the permission  of Tonnaleuka, to indulge you at this  time, because I believe that the danger of my visit  leading to your discovery, is now much diminished.  I thank God that you have so long escaped;  for your enemies were much inflamed at the  slaughter of their companions, and, for some time,  very ardent in their search after you. Oh, Charles!  it was well that you had such a place of refuge.  Were you now to fall into their hands, I fear that  in their rage, they would at once consign you to  destruction!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Be not alarmed for that, my love!" said he.  "I might, indeed, if now in their power, be more  strictly confined, and perhaps more harshly treated  than before my escape; but they would have  no plea for endangering my life. European usages,  you are aware, my too timid girl, acknowledge  the right of every prisoner of war, except he be  on parole, to regain his liberty by any means he  can."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It may be so," she replied; "but what power  is there here, in this Wilderness, to constrain their  compliance with these usages? Alas! may we not  fear that the example of the Indians would<pb n="38"/> reconcile them to the destruction of an obnoxious prisoner;  and it is reported that they have lately  used horrible threats against you, on account of  the loss of their men."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"They may have done so," said he; "but,  Maria, here you know there is no danger, and if  you would only sometimes bless me, as you do  now, with your presence, I think I could become  content to pass my days even in this dungeon.  Oh! if we had but had the good fortune to have  united our fates---but I will not now annoy you  with this subject. Only---only promise to visit  me often, and I shall here be happy!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, Charles!" she replied, "if it were not  imprudent, I would feel but too much inclined to  visit you. But I must be cautious, and indulge  neither my wishes nor your own to the endangering  of your safety."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"And will you deny me?" he cried; "Oh, surely  you cannot, merely on the cold calculation of  some trifling, some scarcely-to-be-imagined danger,  deny me the only enjoyment that can make  my abode here---that could make my existence  any where, tolerable. Oh Maria, deprive me of  your society, and you will bid me at once despair!"</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Be calm, Charles!" said she, "I have no intention  to exclude myself entirely from you; but  my visits must not be frequent, and they must only  be when Tonnaleuka permits---for it is he whose  wisdom has hitherto regulated all my conduct,  better than I myself could have done."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I will then weary the prophet with prayers,"  said he, "and he will not refuse to indulge me in  the only happiness my soul is now capable of  knowing."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Tonnaleuka," she observed, "will only do in  this matter what your safety and my case of mind<pb n="39"/> will thoroughly warrant. I wish you to expect no  more from him, my Charles. Oh! would to heaven,  that you were safe again with your friends in  Philadelphia!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"And banished from thee, my Maria! Ah, how  can you wish to drive me so far from you! Here,  even here, in this dungeon, enclosed in the bowels  of the earth, I feel happier, because I am near  thee, because I can often hear of thee, and perhaps  sometimes see thee, than if I were in the  midst of my friends, surrounded with all the smiles  and the pleasures of social enjoyment, without thee.  Alas, Maria! will the day never come when I shall  introduce thee to those friends, to that social life,  which thou art so eminently formed to ornament  and enjoy? How would my friends rejoice in  thee! how would society admire thee, and how  would I exult, and adore thee! Oh Maria, if  thou wert once mine, all this beatitude would  soon be our lot!"</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Charles," said she, "you are too visionary,  you are too sanguine of what the world might think  of me. You have been pleased to think well of  me yourself, and hence you think every person  else must do so. Restrain these flights of fancy,  these poetical dreams of yours, and look at what  is more likely to be the world's estimate. It may  gaze at me, but so would it gaze at any savage  from the wilderness, for strange sights I am told  will always draw its attention; and as to your  friends, they would be likely to say, `It was indeed  an unlucky day for poor Charles, when he  first went among the savages, to get himself and us  entangled and burthened with this woman, who is  come amongst us without a penny---a rude, uncultivated  daughter of the desert. The loss of the  expedition he conducted, was not to him, and to  us, such a provoking misfortune as this!"</p>

If you wish me often  to visit you, I desire you will speak common sense  to me; for I assure you that, although I have been  brought up in a country of savages, I am not absolutely  a fool."</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Alas, Maria! you are too severe with me.  Oh! believe me, I speak truth when I say, that my  words have never expressed to you half the admiration  of my heart for your beauties and your virtues.  But, forgive me if I be too warm. My  heart is now open to you, and, by heavens! I cannot  help it. My love!" here he again pressed  her hand to his glowing lips, while, with a sigh,  he continued---"Oh! my love, little do you indeed  know what this heart feels for you!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I am aware," said she, unconsciously returning  his sigh, "that you love me, Charles; and  hence I can well know what you feel, for, alas!  my own heart feels too fondly---too strongly---the  softness, the tenderness, the fervency of true love.  But we must change the subject. I came here to  soothe your feelings, to allay your impatience under  confinement, and to encourage you, all in my  power, to support it; and not to dissolve you into  weakness, or reduce you to foolishness. I would  have you to be resolute, to be manly, and rational;  and restrain these inordinate emotions, which only<pb n="41"/> the feeble-minded and the effeminate will permit  to overcome them."</p>

I will  bear, and I will try to bear without repining, the  delay of calling thee mine, which fate has prescribed,  perhaps, as a punishment for my excessive  love. When thou seest me getting weak, Oh Maria!  only tell me, and I will be strong if I should  die under the effort."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here the approach of Tonnaleuka was heard,  and Charles had just let go her hand, which ever  since her entrance he had held in his, when the  prophet appeared.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Hail to you, my children!" said he, "I am  glad that you can yet meet in safety. But, alas!  dangerous times are coming upon the Wilderness,  when the two most powerful nations on earth will  combat here, and make the most secret depths of  the desert ring to their very entrails with the fury of  their combats. But, my children, I will not shock  you, now when you are happy, with a description  of the evils that are approaching, for I trust that  you will both escape the desolation they will entail  upon multitudes. Here, at least, in the worst  of times, I expect there will be found by the meek  and the humble, safe shelter from storms that will  level to the dust the mighty and the renowned!  My children, be of good cheer, for after the fury  of this storm is expended, one of the powerful  nations will yield, and to those who survive here,  an age of peace and happiness shall arrive, bringing  days more prosperous and bright than ever  before shone upon the desert. Then shall come  to pass the saying of the Hebrew oracle, `The<pb n="42"/> Wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad  for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom  as the rose."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Father," said Charles; "that the recent transactions  in this country will occasion a war to break  out between Great Britain and France, I doubt not.  Great troubles will consequently be here, for this  neighbourhood will naturally be one of the first  scenes of the fierce contention---and oh! that this  fair, but tender flower of the forest could be removed  to a more secure soil before that stormy  period commences! Father, do you not think  that this could be accomplished? Could she not  accompany me?"---</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said the prophet, interrupting him---  "there are many obstacles in the way. If ever  it be accomplished, it must be done with a strict  regard to all the rules of propriety. At least, my  son, if I can influence the actions of this child of  my instruction, she never will yield for one moment  to consult inclination or even to yield to terror  in the commission of any act that may exhibit  the faintest shade of offence against feminine propriety;  and let me add, that I believe her determination  to act properly and becomingly in all  cases, and in defiance of all inducements to the  contrary, is as firm and unalterable as I could  wish it."</p>

<p>"Therefore, my son, although she loves you,  and although the horrors of war may here assail  her even to destruction, yet, except under circumstances  wherein no duty can be broken, no principle  either of religion, honour, or decorum infringed,  you may solicit her to fly with you from  the scene of evils, but I am persuaded you will  solicit in vain."</p>

<p>"My son, until the Great Father shall entitle  you in the opinions of men to be her protector,<pb n="43"/> which you are aware, under present circumstances,  cannot take place, it will be well if you refrain  from disturbing her with solicitations to  which she cannot yield, since there would be impropriety  in her doing so."</p>

<p>"Now, my children, it is time for you to separate.  Daughter, attend me: I wish to conduct  you home while it is yet day."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria arose, when her lover catching her by  the hand, exclaimed, "Ah! are you going to leave  me? But it must be. O! let me beg, in the  presence of this our good father, that you will  soon indulge me with another precious visit!"</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It will be whenever our father pleases," returned  Maria, looking at the prophet with an expression  of countenance which very much favoured  Charles's request.</p>

<p>Shortly after the foregoing visit of Maria to  her lover's cavern, the first marriage that ever  took place between the children of Britain in the  Wilderness, was celebrated. As the parties to this  nuptial treaty have already been in the reader's  presence, and have, I trust, made upon his mind,  if not a very deep, at least not an unfavourable  impression, I shall take the liberty, for which, with  all the humility possible in an author, I crave indulgence,  to expend a few pages in relating some  of the circumstances connected with a transaction  which had, upon these parties, the very important  effect of binding them together for life.</p>

<p>To keep the reader no longer in suspense as to  the happy couple, I shall broadly name them, viz.  Andrew Killbreath, M. D., late of the city of Philadelphia,  and Nancy Frazier, eldest daughter of  Mr. Gilbert Frazier, of Frazier's-Field, at the  forks of Turtle Creek and the Monongahela.---  After this precise annunciation, there can be no  mistake as to the identity of the persons: I shall  therefore go on to show the marriage.</p>

<p>The bridegroom, that is, the Doctor, was, as in  this case became him, the grand spring in moving<pb n="45"/> the whole machine of the matter. He had long  solicited the hand of the fair Nancy, and she had  been nothing loth to let him have it. Besides this,  her father and mother, and every one else that had  any thing to say in the affair, had assented to her  becoming the Doctor's wife; and the latter had,  for many months, found only one obstacle in the  way of his getting possession of the desired premises,  which was, the want of some proper person  to perfect the deeds. The arrival of the  Chaplain that accompanied Charles Adderly's last  expedition, seemed to remove this obstacle, and to  offer to the Doctor the prospect of immediate happiness.  But the Doctor found in this matter, as  many another clever fellow in this precious world  had done, that there is, as the old saying has it,  "many a slip between the cup and the lip."</p>

<p>I had at the time more important business on  hand, otherwise I should have related the Doctor's  joy on finding so desirable a personage as the  Chaplain along with the expedition, and the measures  that he, in consequence, adopted to avail  himself of that lucky circumstance. There is,  however, no time lost, and I beg leave now to  atone for the omission.</p>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Now, Nancy," said he, running to his fair one,  as soon as he learned that the Chaplain was forthcoming,  and taking her aside---"Now, my dear,  there need be no longer any delay of our happiness.  Mr. Adderly has brought a clergyman with  him, who can make us man and wife. If you will  consent to it, I shall talk to his reverence on the  subject, and engage him to perform the ceremony,  as soon as you shall think convenient. But, O!  my dear, let it be soon!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"Have you spoke to my father about it yet?"  asked Nancy.</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="46"/>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"No, my love; but I am sure he will have no  objection. You know he has long since said that  he had none to our marriage, provided we had a  clergyman convenient to perform it. Now we  have a clergyman, Nancy, and I expect your father  will keep his word."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"I expect so too," said she; "and if he has no  objection---then---then---But you and he for it,  Doctor!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Oh, my dear! give me a sweet kiss for that,"  said the Doctor. "I will immediately converse  with your father, and have the happy day appointed."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"You may do as you think proper," was Nancy's  reply. He took another fervent kiss, pressed  her hand softly, and hastened away, with great  animation of manner, in search of Gilbert.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>If Gilbert had at all any scruples on the subject,  it arose from this clergyman not being a Presbyterian. "It was unfortunate," he said, "that he  should belong to the prelacy, wha had only cleared  aff a sma' part o' the abominations o' the whore  o' Babylon, as the worthy gospel minister o'  Maughrygowan, Alexander Carmichael, used to  say." These scruples, however, soon gave way  before the weight of the Doctor's rhetoric, and  Gilbert consented, that on that day the  learned Doctor should become his son-in-law.</p>
            </quote>

<p>The Doctor thought, perhaps justly enough,  that there was no good reason for waiting to such  a distant period; but Gilbert stated, that one  month was the exact length of time which had, on  appointing the day, been fixed for himself to wait  for the attainment of Nelly's hand; and insisted  that the Doctor was capable of exerting as much  patience as he then was, and that he should now submit  to do so. The Doctor, not being able to do<pb n="47"/> better, acquiesced, sagaciously observing, that the  longest month would have an end.</p>

<p>But, alas! if either the Doctor or Gilbert had  possessed the spirit of prophesy, they would not  have agreed to such a distant period; and Tonnaleuka,  who might perhaps have set them right in  the matter, was not consulted.</p>

<p>The capture of Charles Adderly's follower happened  in the interval; and before the heavilymoving  month had gone past, the ill-starred clergyman  had been obliged to take up his quarters in  Fort Le Boeuf.</p>

<p>The Doctor and Nancy were much afflicted at  this untoward accident, this dashing of the cup of  bliss out of their hands, when it had almost approached  their lips. But the Doctor was a man of  sense; and, therefore, instead of sitting down, and  uselessly lamenting his misfortune, he set his mind  to work to discover how he should best repair it.  But first, having a good deal of mettle in his composition,  he resolved to convince his mistress of it,  by inflicting a blow of some kind upon the French,  in revenge for the injury they had done him. He  accordingly joined, heart and hand, in the scheme  which Paddy had projected for the destruction of  Charles's escort. Soon after this exploit, however,  he began to think, that from the French themselves  he might obtain a remedy for his misfortune. Their  Chaplain, he conceived, must be as capable of  making husbands and wives as any other Chaplain;  and, although he should use the form prescribed  by the Romish church, yet that form would still  be a christian one, and would, if it erred at all, err  only on the safe side, by using too much ceremony  instead of too little. To get bound to his Nancy,  was the great object for which he longed; and, if  he could only get this Catholic priest to do it, if it<pb n="48"/> should be a little overdone, he could readily excuse  him.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Abbeville had been too long a military  priest, and was too deeply versed in Montaigne's  Essays, to feel any great scruple of conscience  in performing a piece of service, of the  kind the doctor wanted, to two young lovers in a  Wilderness, although they should be heretics.  He therefore consented without hesitation to  spend a merry night at Frazier's, and make the  doctor happy.</p>

<p>There was another obstacle, however, which  the doctor found more difficulty in removing.  This was the conscientious scruples of both Gilbert  and Nelly, in assenting to the marriage of  their daughter by one of the priests of Antichrist.  The doctor had anticipated this; and, therefore,  besides exerting all the artillery of his own eloquence,  he took care to secure the powerful aid  of Paddy's, who, in a few conversations, drew over  his mother to the side of the lovers.</p>

<p>Gilbert stoutly maintained his integrity for some  days, but at length yielded rather to the importunities  and entreaties of his whole family, than to  his own conviction on the matter, observing---</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"Weel, my bairns, gin ye will marry, e'en in  the name o' Gracious, do sae, an' dinna teaze  me mair aboot it. It is better to marry than to  burn, Saint Paul says; an', feggs, gin ye didna  marry noo wi' my wull, ye micht do waur in spite  o' me. I dinna like them limbs o' the pope. But  they ca' themsel's Christians, though the fule fa'  me! gin they ken aucht aboot it; yet syne ye  maun gang thegither, its better to be married in  their gate than no be married ava. It was an auld  saying in Maughrygowan, `O' twa puddles, aye  choose the cleanest.'"</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="49"/>

<p>In consequence of this reasoning on the part of  Gilbert, every obstacle was removed, and the 17th  of March---Patrick's day, dear reader! a day to  which Gilbert's heart was always partial---was  fixed for the wedding.</p>

<p>The preparations for celebrating a day so important  in the annals of Gilbert's family, occupied  the attention of his whole household for nearly a  week. Gilbert, having once given his assent to  have the thing done, resolved to put forth his  might to have it done genteelly, and therefore  spared no pains on the occasion. Paddy also  greatly exerted himself; and as he was at this  time on a more than usually intimate footing with  the officers of the garrison, for, ever since the affair  of Bear's-creek, he had been extremely assiduous  in cultivating their good will, he procured  from their stores a supply of luxuries which could  not then have been elsewhere procured in the  Wilderness. He had, also, with the view of ingratiating  himself still more firmly into their good  graces, invited several of them, and two or three  of their ladies, to the ceremony; having resolved  in his own mind that the festivities of the day should  conclude with a ball.</p>

<p>As to the part which was assigned to Maria in  these preparations, they were both zealously undertaken  and efficiently performed. The regulation  of the bride's dress, the decoration of the  room, the arrangement of the table economy,  and such like, were what principally came under  her management. As to Mrs. Frazier, every  good house-wife, who has had to prepare a marriage  feast, knows that she had a thousand things  to do, and it has been satisfactorily ascertained,  that she neglected none of them.</p>

<p>In short, the great day at length came, and just  about the hour of noon, the "holy man,"<pb n="50"/> accompanied by five officers and three ladies, came  gaily to the door.</p>

<p>Nancy was enclosed in a small room with Maria,  who was decorating her for the occasion, when  she perceived this merry party advancing past the  window.</p>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"Oh, Maria dear!" she exclaimed, "there  they are! what shall I do? I never shall be able  to face those impudent looking officers, and funny  looking ladies. Oh, I feel already ashamed!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Fear nothing," said Maria; "it is a trying occasion,  I acknowledge; but I am convinced you  will go through it creditably. Why, Nancy, you  really look so well that you need not be ashamed  to show yourself in any place, or before any company."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"But they will be all looking at me," returned  Nancy; "Oh! how will I stand it! If none but  our own family were to be present, I could do well  enough, I believe---but such a number of strangers!---  I wish Paddy had been far enough when  he asked them."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You must have courage, Nancy," observed  her sister; "the two or three first minutes will  carry you over the whole difficulty. The first  look at you will give these people a favourable  impression; and they will not, for civility's sake,  you may depend on it, after that, attempt to stare  at you, at least with any rudeness or intention to  hurt your feelings."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"I wish the affair was over altogether!" returned  the bride.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I myself wish it, I assure you," said Maria,  "both for your sake, and my own, for I anticipate  that it will be too jovial a scene for my taste.  But, Nancy, we must have courage, and perform  our parts as well as we can. Your part, I am  aware, will be by far the most difficult; but I am<pb n="51"/> persuaded you will acquit yourself properly. Keep  up a good spirit; you will get through it more  easily than you expect.",</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"I shall get through it," replied Nancy, "I  know I shall, but then I doubt it will be with a  great deal of blundering; for I really know nothing  about such a matter."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Nor is it necessary, I presume," said Maria.  "I should suppose, that it is the priest's duty to  inform you. Every young woman who is going  to be married is not supposed to be acquainted  with the forms of the ceremony. The contrivers  of these forms must, therefore, have provided for  this circumstance."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>"There is no help for it now," said Nancy; "I  must just do my best, but I could almost wish that  I had not to undergo the trial."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Why, are you not getting a good man and a  fond lover for your husband?" observed Maria,  "and will not that atone for any little temporary  inconvenience of this nature. But, believe me,  you will not feel half the confusion you expect."</p>
            </quote>

<p>At this moment her mother entered to inquire  if Nancy was ready to be introduced to the company.  A few minutes more made her so, and  blushing "like the dawning of morn," this fair  wood-nymph was attended by her still fairer sister  into the presence of the gay French ladies and  gentlemen, who were burning with curiosity to see  them. Expecting only to behold raw, clownish,  and coarse girls, little superior either in appearance  or cultivation to the squaws that performed  their menial services, how great was their astonishment,  when these connoisseurs saw entering  their presence, in simple, neat, and elegant attire,  two beautiful females, so attractive, and yet so  modest, that they might have passed for Diana  and one of her nymphs come from the classic<pb n="52"/> plains of Greece to hunt in this unknown Wilderness.</p>   

<p>Immediately a thousand bows were made, and  a thousand compliments paid by the officers, with  all the rapidity and volubility of true Gallican politeness.  The French ladies also received our  two buds of the forest with politeness and good  humour, although they could not but be conscious  that they were surpassed by them in all those  charms and graces of person on which they, in  reality, had some reason to value themselves.</p>

<p>Nancy understood a little French, but Maria  spoke it almost as freely as English. She, therefore,  took the burthen of conversing with these  ladies upon herself.</p>

<quote rend="Madam Vamploise"><p>"Why, Miss Frazier," observed Madame de  Vamploise, "this is really a novel and charming  scene to which we have been invited. I should  not have missed the delight of being here to-day  for the world."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"The business of this day is, indeed," said Maria,  "altogether a novelty here. I believe that  nothing of the kind has before taken place in these  woods. The singularity of the situation, and other  circumstances, for a wedding-party, it is natural  should make some impression on your mind; and,  as you have no doubt the good nature to view  some things with indulgence which you cannot altogether  approve, so you may, perhaps, on account  of not having expected much to give satisfaction,  be inclined to yield to what is really  tolerable, more credit than it deserves."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Madam Vamploise"><p>"I see nothing," returned the French lady,  "but what the most fastidious would acknowledge  to be delightful; and the occasion is so interesting---  a beautiful young woman going to be married  to a fine looking young man---really, Miss Frazier,  the whole is charming! What say you,<pb n="53"/> Madame Joncaire, is it not charming? But the bride  herself---I must have her opinion."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Nancy sat silent, pretending not to have noticed  this intimation to join in the discourse, while Madame  Joncaire observed---</p>

<quote rend="Madame Joncaire"><p>"It is, indeed, admirable! and in the wild woods  too!---who would have dreamed of such a thing!  and such a place, and such people!---Why, Madame  de Vamploise, I am really charmed! But  I wish to hear the bride's opinion of the matter.  My dear," said she, addressing Nancy, "will you  favour us---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Frazier"><p>Nancy, finding that she was compelled to speak,  replied, with as much good humour as she could,  to her garrulous companions---"I have not had  sufficient means of judging how these things should  be, to know whether we are here likely to conduct  them right or wrong. But we shall do the  best we can to make you and the rest of our company  comfortable."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Madam Vamploise"><p>"La! now," returned Madame De Vamploise,  "this is not what we want to know. We want to  know, my dear, how you like your present situation---  We are so charmed with it, that we hope  you too feel happy. Why, I remember when I  was myself going to be married---It was at Bourdeaux,  a very gay place, I assure you---how I felt!  for the whole world was present---and Monsieur  de Vamploise was so gay and agreeable, not like  the dry, prim, Dutchman-looking piece of gravity  that he now is---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur Vamploise"><p>"Heh! what say you now, my chucky?" cried  De Vamploise, who had heard these flattering observations  of his helpmate, as she intended he  should. "Why, to be sure I was always pleasant---  but, as to your Dutch comparison, my dear---  Why shouldn't a Dutchman be as pleasant as another  man? Answer me that, my spouse!"</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="54"/>

<quote rend="Monsieur d'Abbeville"><p>Here the priest interposed. "No catechising,  I beg of you," said he. "It is my province to be  inquisitor; and I will inquire of our fair bride  here, whether you, Madame de Vamploise, have  given her fair play in your discourse, for I know  it is seldom that you give it to any body."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Madam Vamploise"><p>"How so! Monsieur d'Abbeville?" demanded  the lady.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur d'Abbeville"><p>"Because you unmercifully exert all your powers  against us," returned the priest, "when one  half of them would be as much as we could have  any reasonable chance of resisting. But, apropos,  I think we had better have this ceremony performed  before dinner, and then we shall be at ease,  and have nothing to do afterwards but enjoy ourselves."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Monsieur Vamploise"><p>"Nobly said, your reverence!" exclaimed Monsieur  de Vamploise; "I second your motion.  What says the bridegroom?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"I have no objection," replied the doctor.  "We are in this matter under the priest's control.  Let him regulate it as he chooses."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur d'Abbeville"><p>"Well, then," returned the priest, "we shall  prepare."---At that instant the sounds of horses'  feet were heard at the door, and the ceremony  was delayed. Paddy Frazier in a few minutes  introduced two travellers to the company, by the  names of Mr. Washington and Mr. Vanbraam.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Joncaire and De Vamploise had seen Washington  before, and immediately recognised him.</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"What! I am really glad to see you, Mr. Washington,"  exclaimed Joncaire, as he shook him by  the hand; "you remember Venango yet, I hope?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Very well," replied Washington; "and I remember  you too. You have kept your words good  with respect to Shanapins, I hear; but no matter,  it is the fate of war, and the sword devoureth  one man as well as another."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="55"/>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"You remark excellently, Mr. Washington.  But I hope you are not come among us this time  with any proposals to drive us from this pleasant  country. By G---d, all the treaties that can ever  be penned in Virginia, will not induce me to leave  it!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"You may rest at ease on that subject at present,"  observed Washington. "I come here on  no official business; I am merely a private visiter."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"Then let us drive public concerns to the devil,  for this day at least, Mr. Washington. We are  come to a wedding, and have nothing to do here  to-day but to be merry. I hope you will have no  objection to join us?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>Washington had been hastily informed by Paddy,  previous to his entering the room, of what was  going on. "I will have no objection in the world,"  he observed in reply to Joncaire. He then hastily  proceeded to pay his respects to each individual in  the room. When he came to Maria, he for a moment  changed colour, and trembled so, that, had  he not possessed an unparalleled command over  himself, which enabled him suddenly to check his  agitation, it would not have failed to betray itself.  As it was, however, Maria alone observed it. She  slightly blushed at the circumstance, which his  keen eye perceived, and from thence imbibed a  hope, a delusive hope, of the nature of her feelings  towards him.</p>
            </quote>

<p>He hastened to seat himself beside the bridegroom,  with whom, in order to divert the current  of his ideas, so that he might the more easily join  in the good humour of the company, he entered  into a lively and interesting conversation on the  topic of this being the first christian wedding ever  given in so remote a part of the country.</p>

<p>The priest having now put on his sanctified  vestments, and all other matters that he deemed<pb n="56"/> essential to the ceremony being adjusted, he ordered  the doctor and his betrothed to kneel together  before him. The whole company also kneeled;  when, having gone through what Gilbert considered  the profane and idolatrous ceremony of the  mass, he proceeded to the more interesting and  essential one of receiving the mutual vows of the  bridal pair, and then, with as much haste as the  forms of his church permitted, he pronounced them  to be husband and wife, and desired the doctor to  imprint the seal of the sacred union upon his wife's  lips. The doctor eagerly obeyed; the priest imitated  him, and every man in the company followed  such a laudable and agreeable example.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="CHAPTER V"> 
<lg>
<l>So peaceful rests without a stone, a name. </l>
<l>What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame,  </l>
<l>How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,  </l>
<l>To whom related, or by whom begot; </l>
<l>A heap of dust alone remains of thee,  </l>
<l>'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be. </l>
<l><emph>Pope.</emph> </l>
</lg>

<p>This important matter being so happily accomplished,  the whole company felt disposed for the  enjoyment of hilarity and mirth. The sly inuendo,  the smart repartee, and the loud laugh, now  exercised the wits and amused the fancies of all  present, until, by the exertions of Mrs. Frazier  and Maria, assisted also by Archy, a plentiful and  luxurious dinner smoked upon the table.</p>

<p>The French showed themselves as good at eating  as they had been at jesting, and, for about  twenty or thirty minutes, appeared to have as keen  a relish for Mrs. Frazier's dainties as for their  own jokes. To this full and comfortable repast  succeeded a liberal supply of excellent wine,  (whether Champaigne or Burgundy, I have not  been informed,) procured by Paddy from the garrison,  to the soul-cheering qualities of which, the  increased gaiety and jollity of the company, particularly  of the French part of it, soon bore testimony.</p>   

<p>An inclination for dancing soon became the consequence  of this overflowing of the spirits; and,  as Paddy possessed a violin, and both Vanbraam  and he were tolerable performers, the strings were<pb n="58"/> soon screwed to their proper pitch, and away went  the merry Frenchmen to the regions of airiness  and joy.</p>

<p>After becoming somewhat relieved and composed  by this first irregular and rather violent explosion  of their bounding spirits, they proposed a  more civilized and rational set of dances, in which  the ladies should bear a part. A regular cotillion  was soon got up, for which Mr. Washington had  the good fortune to secure Maria as his partner.</p>

<p>But I will not detain the reader with a formal  description of the amusements of this evening;  during which, the noble appearance and accomplished  manners of Washington rendered him a  great favourite with the French ladies, while the  uncommon beauty, and the thousand graces that  sparkled round Maria, excited the unbounded admiration  of the officers. Washington was happy---  for Maria, studious to give him no cause of uneasiness,  paid him every attention, and spared no  pains to render his situation agreeable; and he  could not but fondly cherish the idea, that if such  partiality did not proceed from love, it might be  brought to end in it.</p>

<p>Indeed, so pointed was the attention which  these two young people paid to each other this  evening, that the French, both men and women,  observed it, and became satisfied that Washington's  present visit was altogether a visit of love.  The officers, therefore, although they were aware  of his political standing and influence as their  enemy, felt no inclination, at the present time, to  inquire farther into his business in their neighbourhood.  They envied, indeed, his good fortune in  making an impression, as they supposed he had  done, on the heart of so lovely a being as Maria,  but this was an envy attended rather with a feeling  of felicitation than of animosity towards him;<pb n="59"/> for they were persuaded that he was worthy of  her, and at that moment felt, perhaps unconsciously,  a sincere wish for the welfare of both these  interesting objects of their admiration, and would  have had no objection to have spent another merry  day at Frazier's, in order to witness their union.  Joncaire, who was the only one of the French  present who could speak English, during the evening  took occasion to banter Washington on the  subject.</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"I think, Mr. Washington," said he, "that it is  in your power to afford us another agreeable day  like this, by giving Monsieur d'Abbeville another  job Suppose you detain us for to-morrow. By  my faith, we will take it as a great kindness."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"There is nothing more remote from my power  at present, I assure you, sir," replied Washington.  "I cannot see how you could have fallen upon  such a conjecture."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"No conjecture," returned Joncaire, "could  be more natural. Who could look at that young  lady without admiration? By heavens! if I were  a young fellow like you, I could not---nay, pardon  me---as it is, I cannot---and my wife says that she  feels the same sentiment towards you. Upon honour,  Mr. Washington, if I did not see that you  are otherwise engaged. I should become jealous of  you. See that leering dame of a wife of mine,  she cannot keep her eyes off you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"It is yourself, sir, I perceive, that she is looking  at," observed Washington, following the direction  of the lady's eyes. "But will you not hurt  her feelings by the levity of these observations?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"No, no," returned the other, "she's too cunning  a puss for that. Besides, you may be easy,  sir, and speak freely; for curse the word of what  we say will she understand."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="60"/>

<p>An idea of retorting upon Joncaire, at least of  diverting the conversation from its original topic,  now occurred to Washington. "If she is so partial  to me," said he, "as you mention, you may  really bless your stars that you secured her before  I saw her, for positively, if she were not the property  of another, I should try to make her my own."</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"Ha! ha!" exclaimed the light-hearted Frenchman,  "there for you now! I knew she had hit  you with her sharp glances, Mr. Washington, although  you alleged that she had cast them at me.  By heavens! sir, you perceive that her eyes are  like the quills of a porcupine."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"That is a strange comparison," returned  Washington. "I rather think they are like the  stars in the firmament."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur Joncaire"><p>"Ha! sir, you are too sublime for me." Here  they were interrupted by De Vamploise, who  wished them to engage in another dance.</p>
            </quote>

<p>The sports and enjoyments of the night were  kept up until the moon arose, which was about  one o'clock in the morning, when the French departed  as gaily as they had come, and a couple of  hours found them snugly deposited in their comfortable  couches at Fort Du Quesne. But before  the half of that period had elapsed, all Gilbert  Frazier's inmates, without excepting the bride  and bridegroom, were as comfortably disposed of.</p>

<p>Washington was up with the dawn, for his heart  was far from being at such ease as either to invite  repose or make it refreshing when it came.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas!" thought he, as he walked out on the  margin of Turtle-creek, "if this most lovely of  created beings refuses my love, how wretched I  shall be! My heart destitute and forlorn, shall  bleed at the desolation of its hopes; but it shall  be still more miserable at the thought of the troubles  and dangers with which, if she will not leave<pb n="61"/> this Wilderness, she will soon be surrounded.  War! shocking and barbarous war with savages,  will ere long penetrate to these wilds; and Maria,  oh, Maria! how I delight to name thee!---Oh, how  wilt thou escape its fury! But I will urge, I will  entreat, I will implore thee to fly with me while  there is yet time, while thou art yet safe, and before  the coming tempest bursts around thee. Oh,  with what eagerness I should march in the ranks  of those brave men who shall be sent here to drive  the enemies of my country from their usurped fastnesses,  if I were sure that she who is dearer to me  than life, would not suffer in the conflict. But I  will prevail on her---O heaven! grant that she  may consent to become my own, that I may lodge  her in a place of safety."</p>
            </quote>

<p>In such contemplations this ardent and illustrious  lover spent upwards of an hour. He returned  to the house, resolved to watch the first opportunity  that should offer, to make known to the dear  mistress of his affections his whole mind---his fears---  his wishes---his warmth of admiration, and his  sincerity of love.</p>

<p>Maria had arisen. He met her smiling sweetly  in all the blooming charms of maiden youthfulness.  She was busied preparing breakfast, and  as she went through the various movements of  household economy required by the occasion, he  perceived in every turn and every gesture, a gracefulness  and ease, which showed that she could  render any task becoming and interesting, and  that she was peculiarly fitted to preside with  dignity, propriety, and grace over all kinds of domestic  concerns.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Oh, that she were once the mistress of my  household!" thought her adoring lover; "how  doubly sweet and delightful would then the shades  of Mount Vernon be to me! It may be so; I may<pb n="62"/> yet be so happy; and the time may not be far  distant. To-day, to-day, I am resolved I shall ascertain  the state of her feelings. Oh, God of  heaven! grant that they may be favourable."</p>
            </quote>

<p>But an unforeseen circumstance prevented him  for that day from becoming, as he had resolved,  certain on this point. The breakfast had been  delayed nearly an hour on account of the bridal  pair, who were rather tardy in making their appearance.  At length they were forthcoming, and  Mrs. Killbreath, covered with blushes, received  the salutations of Washington and the rest of the  family; and cheerfulness and gaiety prevailed  throughout the conversation, with which they seasoned  the most comfortable, because generally  the most simple and domestic of all meals, the  breakfast.</p>

<p>This meal, however, was scarcely over, when  the cheerfulness and satisfaction of the party, especially  of Maria, became overcast, by a message  from queen Alliquippa, with intelligence that she  had become suddenly very ill, and was not expected  to live many hours; and that, conscious herself of  her approaching end, she had requested to see  Maria before she died.</p>

<p>Maria immediately set out in obedience to this  summons. When she arrived at the wigwam, she  found the queen just recovering from a strong convulsive  fit which had left her much exhausted.  She was, however, sensible of the presence of her  favourite, and pressed her hand in token of the  satisfaction she enjoyed from her visit. Maria  wept over her, for she felt that she was about to  lose for ever one of her dearest and most valued  friends.</p>

<p>Her grief seemed grateful to the queen's mind.  The violent tremors and emotions that agitated  her nearly exhausted frame somewhat subsided;<pb n="63"/> and the power of articulation, which appeared to  have been gone for ever, returned for a space,  and enabled her to say---</p>

<quote rend="Alliquippa"><p>"Maria, my daughter, thou art kind. It pleases  me to see that thou lovest me. But do not grieve  too much. Some day thou wilt follow thy mother."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>Here the sounds, although continued,  could not be distinguished, and the weeping Maria  replied: "My mother! my ever affectionate and kind  mother! thou art going to leave me. I will  indeed regret---bitterly and long will I regret, thy  departure, for thou wert ever good and kind to  thy daughter. Oh! canst thou not bless me before  thou goest?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Alliquippa"><p>In a faint murmur the queen prayed--- "Oh,  Maneto, bless my child!" Immediately the  muscles of her body became slightly agitated  with a short-continuing convulsion, during which  the soul fled its frail tenement; and on its subsiding,  Alliquippa was found to have returned to  her original dust.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria kissed the cold inanimate lips of her deceased friend, and withdrew in great agitation. The Indians, especially their females, loudly lamented this public calamity that had befallen their tribe. Alliquippa had, indeed, been always much beloved by them, for the indulgent, kind, and parental manner in which she had at all times exercised her authority. For some months past she had intermeddled very little with public affairs. The French influence in the country, since their establishment at Du Quesne, she was unable to resist, and she could not without breaking her faith with the English, join in promoting it. Besides, since the death of king Shingiss, to whom she had in reality been much attached, she more than ever hated them as being the cause of his destruction.</p>

<pb n="64"/> 

<p>Her tone of mind, and strength of body had ever  since that fatal event been gradually and perceptibly  declining; and, although her last mortal attack  of sickness was sudden, yet that depression  of the spirits, that wasting of the frame, which,  ever since the battle of Shanapins, had been visible  to every observer, could not fail to impart the  opinion that she was hastening to the world of spirits,  the happy land where the brave and the upright,  the faithful and the affectionate, shall meet  to enjoy each other's society for ever, undisturbed  by the warwhoop, or the song of slaughter and revenge;  where men shall no longer pant for each  other's ruin, where no blood shall be shed, except  that of the deer and the buffalo, and warriors shall  be proud of no exploits but the destruction of the  wild beasts of the forest.</p>

<p>When the account of Alliquippa's death reached  Frazier's, Washington and Paddy set out for the  purpose of bringing Maria home. As the latter  choosed to remain some time at the wigwam, for  the purpose of showing the Indians his respect for  their deceased queen, he left the task of conducting  his sister home altogether to Washington.  Had her mind been in its usual state, her lover  could not have wished for a more favourable opportunity  of making known to her his wishes; but  his soul was of too delicate a nature to obtrude  upon her, in her affliction, that disclosure of his  feelings and desires which he longed to make.  During their walk, therefore, the conversation  chiefly turned upon the history and character of  the deceased.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You will not be surprised, Mr. Washington,"  said Maria, "that I feel so much for the loss of  this Indian princess, who has been to me ever  since my infancy, the most constant of friends, a  companion in pastime, a sister in tenderness, and<pb n="65"/> a mother in affection. By this stroke of fate, I  really feel bereaved of a long cherished source of  happiness."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"It is, indeed," replied Washington, "a great  trial for a sensible and grateful mind to witness  the death of a beloved object, and one too from  whose affection it has been accustomed to derive  happiness; and these trials must still be most severely  felt in the days of youth, when the frequency  of their occurrence has not in any manner  strengthened the heart against their impression.  But, Maria, you know the duty of resignation to  the will of heaven. I need not teach it to you; it  is enough to remind you of it; and what is duty,  you are aware, should, at all times, obtain the preeminence  over feeling."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You are right, Mr. Washington," she replied.  "I know it is my duty not to repine at such a dispensation.  I therefore do not repine. But it  would be unnatural, nay, I believe it would be a  breach of duty, not to feel for the irreparable loss  of such a friend."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"To feel is, indeed, natural," said Washington;  "nay, not to feel would argue an insensibility  of heart, unamiable, offensive, and culpable. But  you, Maria---ah! you do not possess this; but---  but---forgive me---I would say, that you should not  call this loss irreparable. Providence can repair  it tenfold for you. Ah, Miss Frazier! you can  never want friends. Every one who sees, who  hears you---but I will not now talk so. I wish  to say, that I do not blame your manifestation  of feeling on this occasion. Nay, it pleases me  to behold it. I esteem you the more for it. Oh,  Maria, Maria!

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Accuse not thyself unjustly," said a voice behind  them. They turned round, and beheld Tonnaleuka.  "Child, accuse not thyself unjustly,"  continued the prophet; "I know every action of  thy life; I know each affection of thy heart; nay, I  know almost the very thoughts of thy soul; and I  know thou art as innocent and pure as the nature  of thy species will permit; and, hear me, maiden,  if there be on earth a being of human origin who  can match thee in purity and excellence, it is the  youth who now stands by thy side."</p>

            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Hear me, my son!" interrupted the prophet,  "for I am sent for, and must, in haste, go to conduct  the obsequies of the queen whom this maiden  deservedly loved as a mother. I know something  of mankind, even in the state you call civilization;  and I know something of you, and can compare  you with your brethren, and if I should ascribe to  you more qualifications than purity; if I should  ascribe to you prudence, courage, humanity, greatness  of soul, and true love for your fellow-men,  and all these in as high a degree as ever man possessed,  I would not ascribe them wrongfully; and  if heaven spares thee to thy country, the opinions  of mankind will confirm my words."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, hear further. I would caution thee  to protect thy heart. I know it to be in danger of  suffering the pangs of disappointment. Beauty  and worth may inflict a wound which they cannot  cure. Adieu, my children!"  So saying, Tonnaleuka  hastily proceeded towards the wigwam,<pb n="67"/> leaving Washington and Maria greatly struck with  the plainness and oracular abruptness of his language  and manner.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas!" ejaculated Washington, almost unconscious  that Maria heard him, "he knows too well  the state of my heart! but what can be the danger  to which he alludes? Disappointment! alas, it  may be so; I may not be capable of inspiring her  with---but, Miss Frazier!" said he, suddenly recollecting  him, "I am raving, forgive me---my concerns  I will not obtrude upon you this evening, as  you may be desirous of devoting it to sorrow for  your lost friend. Let me only entreat that you  will not indulge the softness of grief to the injury  of your health; and that in reflecting upon one  lost friend, you will remember that there are many  yet left you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I thank you, Mr. Washington," said she, "for  the consoling idea; and shall be careful to bear  the goodness of God to me in this respect constantly  in mind, so that, instead of murmuring at  my lot, I trust I will be enabled to feel grateful."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Amidst such discourse, the road to Frazier's  house was soon passed over, and Maria retired for  the rest of the evening to her apartment. Here,  after long meditating upon the friendship and the  worth of Alliquippa, her thoughts fondly turned  upon Charles Adderly, the warmth, the fervour,  the faithfulness, the devotedness of his passion for  her, the consciousness of which had now become  the great solace of her existence, and the return of  which had entwined, or rather identified itself with  all her feelings.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, in the fervour  of her meditations upon him, "while thou livest I  know I shall never be destitute of a friend. Oh,  heaven! protect this object of my first and only<pb n="68"/> love---for if he were snatched from me, then---  then should I indeed be miserable!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>Her reflections next reverted to Washington.  "I cannot but perceive," thought she, "that this  excellent young man loves me. If, indeed, it were  God's will, I should wish that it were otherwise;  for, although I may esteem, I may admire, his numerous  and engaging accomplishments and eminent  virtues, yet I cannot return him love for love. My  heart cannot be his: it is too sincerely and exclusively  given up to another. Oh Washington, Washington!  for thy own sake, excellent, admirable  young man! how fervently do I wish that thou  wouldst fix thy affections upon one who could return  them---for thou art worthy of being beloved---  alas, I know it---and yet I cannot love thee."</p>
            </quote>

<p>She would then reflect upon the transitory nature  of all human enjoyments, cares, and feelings.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"How happy did I long feel," she would say,  "in the possession of the parental affections of  that kind and amiable being who is now no more.  Never more will she smile upon me, and press me  to her bosom; never more shall I listen to the  words of instruction, to the lessons of virtue, that  flowed from her lips! Alas; those lips, and the  warm heart that beat in that bosom, are now cold  and insensible, and will soon mingle with their  kindred earth. Never more will they feel the  glow of affection, or utter the words of kindness.  Never more will they contrive benefits for me, or  speak comfort to my soul. But why do I say never?  Is there not another, and a happier world,  wherein faithful friends, who are thus separated,  are destined again to meet, and enjoy each other's  society for ever? Yes, thanks to the great Deity,  there is such a world! My departed friend believed  it---Tonnaleuka believes it---my parents have  taught me to believe it---the sacred oracles of our<pb n="69"/> faith confirm it---the heavens, and the earth, and  the whole face of nature show it---and all our harassed  feelings, our disappointments, and misfortunes;  our bereavements, our pains, and our sorrows  of this world, all find consolation and solace  in the idea. Glory to God for it! I will cherish,  I will dwell upon the sweet reflection, and anticipate,  even here, the delights of a future existence!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>In this manner did Maria spend this evening;  while Washington endeavoured to divert the anxiety  which the obvious import of Tonnaleuka's  oracular expressions occasioned in his mind, by  trying to explain it away, or at least to attach to it  such a degree of uncertainty as might still keep  open the door for hope.</p>

<p>The prophet says, that I am in danger of suffering  the pangs of disappointment, thought he. But  he may not mean the kind of disappointment which  I most dread;---he may not mean the disappointment  of that devoted love I bear for this young  woman. Or, if he does mean it, how can he know  the revolutions of the female heart? He may be  aware, or may imagine, and perhaps, alas! too  truly, that she does not at present love me. But  surely, if this be even so, I may still hope for some  good to arise from my assiduities, from the fervency  and fidelity of my passion, of which it must now  be my study to convince her. She has a good  heart, and will not bear to see me drag out a life  of continued misery, when it is in her power to relieve  me. I will trust in Providence, and hope  that He who moveth all hearts, will turn hers towards  me.</p>

<p>The next day, Washington attended to witness  the funeral of Alliquippa. She was dressed in the  full costume to which she was accustomed in the  days of her greatest glory. All the great men and  warriors, together with a numerous company of the<pb n="70"/> females of her tribe, were present; and her successor,  who was named Susquelooma, a near relative  of Swanalow her husband, and who had for  some time past been entrusted with the management  of the public affairs, attended as chief  mourner.</p>

<p>The bier on which she was carried to the grave,  consisted of two long poles, joined together by  a rude structure of wicker-work, covered with  leaves. Tonnaleuka, as the prophet of the tribe,  walked before the procession, with his sacred  wand extended forward. The corpse followed,  and close to if the chief mourner; then came the  sages and elders of the tribe, and then the older  and more celebrated warriors; after them, the  younger and less celebrated, all in pairs. The females  of the tribe then succeeded, also in pairs,  taking precedence according to their age, or rather  according to the order of Tonnaleuka, who  had arranged the whole proceeding. Washington,  and those of Gilbert Frazier's family who attended,  closed the procession.</p>

<p>They had about half a mile to go to the burial  ground, which was a little way up the side of a hill  fronting the southeast, not far from Turtle Creek.  Here they had dug a grave in such a form, that  when the body was laid in it, the feet were considerably  lower down than the head; and as it was  turned somewhat upon its right side, with the face  to the rising sun, it appeared to lie in a gently reclining,  rather than a horizontal posture.</p>

<p>When the procession reached this last abode of  mortality, and placed the bier with the corpse  upon it alongside of the grave, Tonnaleuka, waving  his wand in the air, addressed the assembly.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Brothers and sisters, before you commence  your funeral dance, before you convey your<pb n="71"/> beloved queen into her last dwelling, and sing over her  the song of your sadness, listen to my words."</p>

<p>"You appear all to be healthy just now, and  full of life, and many of you, no doubt, promise  yourselves the enjoyment of a long existence---for  there are many of you yet young. But listen to  me. What avails health, or youth, or the full tide  of flowing blood, when Maneto says you must die?  Then disease or accident, or perhaps the hatchet  of war, does its duty; and then we return, as the  queen our sister has done, our bodies to the earth  of which they were made, and our souls to the  Great Spirit who made them in a manner he has  not revealed to us. Why, then, should we be  proud of this life, or seek to render any of our fellow-mortals,  who may enjoy its transitory existence,  miserable?"</p>

<p>"Alas! listen to me. The existence is but transitory,  whether it be of joy or of misery, that we  can experience here. She who lies there, I have  seen young, happy, admired, and beloved. Many  of you have also seen her so. Think of it, brothers  and sisters: does it not appear as if it were  but yesterday? But look at her now! Where  are the smiles which drew warriors after her?---  where are the graces which captivated counsellors  and chiefs?---where is that dignity of mien,  and that authority of expression, which both men  and women delighted to obey? Alas! they are  to her as if they had never been, and to us their  existence is like a shadow, passing only through  our recollection, as if we had but seen it in a  dream! Such will be the fate of the sensations of  all here---nay, of all mankind! We are but the  insects of a day: the fleeting hour of sunshine  passes---the night of death comes, and we are no  more! So rapid, and of such little consequence,  is our present existence."</p>

<pb n="72"/>

<p>"But listen to me, brothers and sisters---The  manner in which we use that existence is of consequence.  And why? Because there is another;  and one to which we must immediately proceed,  and receive the reward of bliss or of wo, as we  have here earned it."</p>

<p>"Listen again! Ye grieve for Alliquippa---ye  think she has been unfortunate, in being thus separated  from you whom she loved to reside among.  But hear me---she has been fortunate in the transition,  because she was virtuous, and good-hearted,  and did her duty, and for these things her spirit  is now receiving a glorious recompense from  the Almighty Maneto!"</p>

<p>"Then, brothers and sisters, what I would now  advise you to do, is this---When you think of her  who lies here, let it be to imitate her virtues. You  will never then have cause to fear the approach of  death---Nay, the sooner he comes, it will be the  better for you, as you will thereby the sooner obtain  the reward of your good conduct from the  justice of the Great Father, who will then receive  you into his favour."</p>

<p>"Now, brothers and sisters, you may perform  your solemnities, and bury your queen. I go to  worship the Great Father."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he waved his wand three times towards  heaven, blessed the assembly, and departed.</p>

<p>Susquelooma now took upon him the direction  of the proceedings, and the death-dance was immediately  commenced. It consisted, in all the  warriors marching one after another in an extremely  slow and solemn gait, somewhat like that adopted  at military funerals in Europe, nine times round  the bier, each warrior as he came to it pausing,  to spread his arms over the corpse, and then raising  them and his face to heaven, as if to say,  "Here on earth is the body, but there in heaven<pb n="73"/> is the soul;" then turning quickly upon his heel,  and drawing both hands slowly from his heart, to  represent the disunion of soul and body, he clasped  them again firmly within each other as he moved  away, in order to show that they should be  again united.</p> 


<p>The body was now lowered into the grave, into  which the leg of a deer, the wing of a dove, a pair  of moccasins, and a string of beads, together with  some twigs of spice-wood and leaves of the sprucepine,  were also thrown.</p>

<p>Susquelooma and several other chiefs then  chanted the death-song, which Tonnaleuka had on  this occasion prepared for them. It was, as nearly  as I can versify it in our language, as follows.---  During its singing, a number of the warriors proceeded  to cover the body with earth in the usual  manner.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka">
<lg>
<l><emph>An Indian Funeral-Song</emph>.  </l>
<l> We lay her in earth whom our sad hearts deplore,  </l>
<l> Where the dust of her fathers was buried before,  </l>
 <l>And where, in our turns, we shall all of us lie,  </l>
 <l>Ere we pass to our sires in the regions of joy!  </l>
 <l>Oh! once she was beautiful, sportive, and young, </l>
 <l>So sprightly she danced and so merrily sung,  </l>
<l> Nor thought, in the midst of her joy and her mirth,  </l>
 <l>That thus her last covering should be the cold earth!  </l>
 <l>We lay her low here---she whose charms could engage  </l>
 <l>The hearts of the warrior, the sachem, and sage:  </l>
 <l>Ah! think of her now, all ye valiant and gay---  </l>
 <l>The charmer of hearts is a cold piece of clay!  </l>
 <l>How bright were the virtues that glow'd in her breast!  </l>
 <l>How sweet was the kindness her visage express'd!  </l>
 <l>In true love her constancy ne'er was surpass'd,  </l>
 <l>And for Shanalow's sake she was firm to the last.  </l>
 <l>But ye of her tribe, ye Shannoahs, deplore,  </l>
 <l>She who rul'd you with love, now will rule you no more:  </l>
<l> Oh! remember her long---and with tears in your eyes,  </l>
 <l>As ye pass, strew with spice-wood the ground where she lies!  </l>   
 <pb n="74"/>
 <l>The soft-growing spice-wood is sweet to the smell, </l>
 <l>The evergreen pine-leaves will constancy tell--- </l>
 <l>Then both we shall scatter as tokens, to prove </l>
 <l>That the sweets of her mem'ry we ever shall love!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>The body being now covered, and the grave filled  with earth, a heap of stones was piled upon it, in  order to mark it out, so that any of her tribe passing  by, might know where to pay the customary  honours to the remains of one who had been long  beloved and respected amongst them. The procession  then returned to Susquelooma's wigwam,  where it dispersed, and Washington took his way,  with Paddy, Archy, and Dr. Killbreath, to Frazier's.</p>   

<p>Maria had not gone to the funeral, as she conceived  that witnessing the solemnities would only  have exposed her spirits, which were now beginning  to recover their tone, to a fresh and unnecessary  depression. It was not, however, until the  afternoon of the following day, that Washington  took occasion to make to her an open avowal of  his sentiments and wishes. He asked her to walk  out with him along the bank of the river, as doing  so, might tend to remove that degree of melancholy  which still evidently pervaded her mind.  She readily complied, and they set out together.</p>

<p>It was one of those premature spring days which  sometimes, in Pennsylvania, enliven the generally  severe month of March, and from their novelty,  together with the fair face of verdant nature which  they disclose just unveiled from the long protracted  covering of winter's snow, make a ramble, for  a short distance, very inviting and agreeable. On  this occasion, Washington and his fair companion  felt their hearts warmed and expanded as they beheld  the symptoms of reviving nature that bloomed  around them, although they were conscious that  before the spring should set really in, storms of<pb n="75"/> wintry fierceness would again overcast and deform  this fair face of things, and nip in the bud the  young plant that now rashly attempted to peep  forth, and leave it in a blasted and undone state to  repent its temerity.</p>

<p>Washington intentionally directed their steps  towards the walnut-tree, beneath whose branches  he had first stopped to gaze upon those charms  that had been fated to make such an impression  upon his heart.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Here, Maria," said he, when they arrived at  the spot, "is the place where I first beheld you;  and from that moment to this, the image that you  then impressed upon my mind has never for one  instant left it---Ah! never, never will it leave it!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Mr. Washington," said she, "I hesitate not to  credit your assertions; for I know that your mind  is superior to the common custom in which the  gay part of your sex, I am informed, indulge  themselves, of seizing all occasions to flatter ours,  even often at the expense of truth. And because  I believe you, and esteem you so sincerely as to  feel an ardent desire for your welfare, I will candidly  say, that I am sorry you should have viewed  me in the light you have done."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"O Maria!" he interrupted her, "do not use  these chilling expressions. How can you, if you  esteem me, and wish for my welfare, regret that  which has afforded me the sweetest sensations of  my life! that which, although it has, indeed, occasioned  me many hours of painful anxiety, has, nevertheless,  been the delight of my existence, the  sacred charm which has often buoyed my hopes  into rapture, and presented to my enamoured  view the lovely vision of felicity which it might  be my lot to enjoy! Oh Maria, do not say you  are sorry for this!"</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, Mr. Washington!" she replied; "if I  respected you less, I might feel less sorrow on this  subject. But you deserve to be happy, and to  make you so, the woman of your choice should  be capable of loving you with an ardour equal to  your own---with an ardour of which I feel, and  must for ever feel, myself incapable. In short,  sir, it is my earnest wish that you should bestow  upon a more suitable object, those affections of  which I am but too conscious I am not worthy."</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Not worthy!" he exclaimed; "not worthy of  my affections! Ah, then, what woman on earth  can be worthy of them? Oh Maria! I have seen,  I have been acquainted with many females; and  if I were to make, in your hearing, the comparison  which my fancy has often formed between  you and the fairest, the best of them, your modesty  would not tolerate it. You would not listen to  me;---you would command me to be silent. Alas!  to draw the picture which my imagination has  formed of your person and your virtues, would  excite your incredulity, and subject me to the suspicion  of insincerity. But with you, with none,  will I ever be insincere. Oh! if you cannot---"</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, "I must interrupt you. If I  thought you could be insincere in any of your professions,  I would abandon every good opinion I  have hitherto had of mankind. I must, therefore,  believe that you do entertain the exaggerated and  erroneous opinion of my good qualities which you  mention. But this is owing to the generous impulse  of your nature, which has led you astray,  and induced you to give me credit for excellences  which I do not possess. Permit me to say, that  you do not know me sufficiently to judge of me  accurately. If you did, it might relieve us both  of much uneasiness. You would see the necessity  of forming a better choice; and, because I know<pb n="77"/> that it would contribute to your happiness, I should  rejoice that you had done so."</p>

Oh Maria! this circumstance is at present  the great, the immediate object of my solicitude.  The legions of a powerful nation will soon carry  their thunders into this forest to root their enemies  out of it. The conflict will be dreadful; and  oh! to what accidents wilt thou not be then exposed?  If thou wilt not fly from peril as my wife,  let us persuade the whole of thy friends also to go.

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," she replied, "you are kind and generous;  but it is your nature, and does not surprise  me---for what virtue could you display that would  surprise me! Yet I would not do myself justice  if I did not express my gratitude for the friendly  solicitude and liberality which has dictated this  proposal: but I cannot see that my father's family  are in such danger as to induce their<pb n="79"/> removal from a place where they have so long resided,  and where they have often, in the worst of times,  of late years, experienced safety."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"The war that is now threatened," observed  Washington, "will be quite different in its extent  and consequences from any they have yet seen;  and as the savage tribes that will be engaged in it  are much exasperated against every thing British,  no doubt its ferocity will be greatly aggravated  beyond any thing that has yet arisen from former  wars in this country. Your family will, therefore,  be more exposed than formerly. Ah! Miss Frazier,  I indeed tremble for your safety, unless you  can be prevailed on to leave this place before the  bloody era commences."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Mr. Washington," she replied, "peculiarly  circumstanced as my father's family is in respect  to all the parties who are likely to engage in the  war you anticipate, I do not suppose, that, unless  some of them take an active part in the quarrel,  there is much danger of our being molested. With  the French and Indians we are now on terms of  intimacy. Our feelings and affections are with  the English, it is true, and the French may suspect  this, yet so long as we join neither party, I think  that neither will injure us. But you may lay your  proposal for our removal before my father. With  his determination in this matter I must of course  comply; but your solicitude on my account must  be kept altogether out of view."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I will try this expedient," said he; "I may  prevail with your father, and by this means have  the satisfaction of securing your safety, to effect  which was the great object of my present visit to  the Wilderness."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria again expressed her thanks for his solicitude  in her hehalf. They then returned to the<pb n="80"/> house, and Washington soon found an opportunity  of laying his proposal before Frazier.</p>

<p>Gilbert had long enjoyed so much safety amidst  the various tribes of warring Indians, and felt himself  at the present time, so secure in the friendship  of both the English and French, in the event of the  war of which Washington spoke, taking place, that  with the strongest expressions of gratitude to that  gentleman for his generous offer, he declined accepting  it, and refused to remove.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"God has aye been gracious to me," said he, in  reply to Washington's reasoning, "since I cam' into  thir backwoods; an' though a' ye represent in sae  freen'ly a manner may be true, yet I wunna noo  mistrust his providence; for ye ken hoo the prophet  reprimanded the godly Asa for trusting in the  strength o' Egypt an' no' in the arm o' the Lord."</p>
            </quote>

<p>In addition to the piety of Gilbert, the wishes  of Washington were, in this instance, opposed by  the policy of Paddy, who observed that if they  even should consent to remove, it would, under  present circumstances, be impossible to do so  without the knowledge of the French, who would  inevitably prevent them.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"The day we should attempt it," said he, "you  may rely on it, a troop of horse, and a tribe of Indians,  at the very least, would surround us, and  force us to take up our abode, not in our own  dwelling again, it is true, but in Fort Du Quesne;  so that all we should gain by the attempt would  be to make them enemies who are now our friends.  No," he added in a whisper to Washington, "I  think we can be of more service to the British  cause by remaining here, and keeping on good  terms with their enemies, for then, you know the  opportunity for a little stratagem in war may be  more conveniently watched."</p>

<p>Washington finding that he could not prevail on  the family to accede to his wishes, and feeling that  his duty to his country required his immediate return  to Virginia, resolved, before his departure, to  do all that remained in his power to effect for the  safety of his beloved, when he should be far distant,  by informing Tonnaleuka of the approaching  dangers, and obtaining from him a promise to be  her protector.</p>

<p>That very evening Paddy Frazier procured him  an interview with the prophet, who seemed to  enter into his views on the subject more fully and  readily than either Gilbert or Paddy.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said Tonnaleuka, when Washington  had made his statement, "I know there will be an  alarming time in this quarter, and I fear that that  young woman will be peculiarly exposed. But make  your mind easy. I will think of your generosity  towards her, and her friends, and shall not be less  solicitous for their safety than yourself. Hers, in  particular, you may be assured I shall watch over  with all the anxiety and care you can wish. Ah,  sir! think you I can be indifferent to the fate of  her who has grown up from her infancy to what  you now see her, under my tuition and care! Be  satisfied, I will protect her as I would the apple  of my eye."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Give me one more promise, my father, and I  shall be satisfied," said Washington; "promise me  that if thy power should fall short in protecting  her, for thy will I do not distrust, thou wilt give  me the speediest intelligence of whatever misfortune  may befall her, so that no time may be lost  before I can fly to her deliverance."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I promise thee this," replied the prophet.  "And since thy country will soon need thee much,  go now, attend to her call, and take my blessing<pb n="82"/> with thee, and may heaven preserve thee long for  the benefit of millions!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Thank thee, father, and farewell!" replied  the hero, and they separated.</p>
            </quote>

<p>The next morning Washington bade a tender  adieu to Maria, and, accompanied by Vanbraam,  left her abode with a heavy and anxious heart,  and pursued his way to Mount Vernon, where he  arrived in about two weeks, without meeting with  any accident.</p>

<p>The intelligence of Charles Adderly's second  defeat, and the establishment of the French in  the fort at the head of the Ohio, had reached the  Atlantic cities, and excited a great ferment over  all the country east of the Alleghany mountains,  several weeks before Washington's second visit to  the Wilderness. It was indeed the anxiety for  Maria's safety which this intelligence naturally  occasioned, and the anticipation of the national  war which he saw would be hastened on by this  affair, that accelerated his visit ere the winter  was over; for he had not, at first, calculated on  paying it until the spring opened, in order that,  if Maria consented to accompany him to Virginia,  the state of the country, the weather, and the roads,  would be better adapted for travelling. Before  he set out for the Wilderness, his exertions and  influence tended much to excite his native colony  to take the lead in those active measures which  were about to be adopted for the infliction of British  vengeance upon the French aggressors; and  when he returned to Mount Vernon, he had the  satisfaction to find that a regiment of four hundred<pb n="84"/> regulars had been raised by the authority of the  Virginia legislature, for the express purpose of proceeding  against the enemy as soon as the season  would permit. Of this regiment he had himself  received the commission of lieutenant-colonel; one  Mr. Fry, a military gentleman, supposed to be  well acquainted with Indian affairs, having been  appointed Colonel.</p>

<p>Hostilities were not yet formally declared between  Britain and France; but the British secretary  of state had written to governor Dinwiddie  that his cabinet considered the attack of the  French upon the Ohio Company's people, and their  fortifying themselves in Du Quesne, as equivalent  to the commencement of hostilities on their  part; and that therefore his majesty's colonies  should conceive themselves at full liberty to attack  and drive off the aggressors by any means in  their power.</p>

<p>In consequence of this authority, Dinwiddie  indulged the zeal of young Washington, who earnestly  solicited permission to march against Du  Quesne as soon as the country was fit to be travelled.  His chief inducement for this urgency  was, that by information he had received from  Paddy Frazier, he knew the French works at Du  Quesne were yet incomplete, but were every day  getting stronger, and as soon as the season  opened, the garrison expected to receive from  Canada a strong augmentation of its force. If  the early part of the season should therefore be  permitted to pass away without attacking the  French, the probability was that they would soon  become in all respects, so strengthened, as to set  any force the colony could send against them, at  defiance.</p>

<p>Washington was extremely anxious for the capture  of this fort, for many reasons; but the one<pb n="85"/> which operated, perhaps, the most powerfully  upon his heart, was, the idea that by such an  event, the seat of war might be kept at a distance  from the residence of Maria. Le Boeuf, Presqu'  Isle, and the plains of Canada, would then become  the theatre of contention; while, by possessing  Du Quesne, its neighbourhood would enjoy  tranquillity, as too much employment would  be given the enemy in the country of the St.  Lawrence, to allow them either leisure or means  to disturb that of the Ohio.</p>

<p>True policy also called for this promptitude of  action which he recommended, as a small force  might now accomplish what in the lapse of only a  few weeks, a formidable army might find impossible.</p>   

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"If you wish to drive the French from Fort Du  Quesne," said he, in a memorial to the governor;  "if you wish to save our border-settlers from the  depredations and horrors which the savage allies  of our enemy meditate against them as soon as  the season will permit their irruptions, you will  attempt it without delay. Time passes on, the  day fast approaches when the Indians will strike  their winter-tents, and prepare for war and devastation.  The enemy which supports and encourages  them to mischief, is every day strengthening  himself. While he is yet weak, the means you  can already command, may drive him from his  strong-hold, afar from our borders, and compel  the barbarous tribes, who do his bidding, to remain  quietly in their own forests, without daring  to search for human victims upon our frontiers."</p>

<p>"If, on the other hand, you delay till the fort  on the Ohio is completed, and until it shall be filled  with troops and stores from Canada, the favourable  moment will have departed for ever, and<pb n="86"/> the power of a nation may not then be able to do  what could now be done by that of a colony."</p>
            </quote>

<p>In consequence of these representations, Colonel  Washington was authorized to proceed, about  the middle of April, with about two hundred regulars  and some militia, with all possible dispatch,  to attack Fort Du Quesne, if he found it adviseable,  with that force; if not, he was to throw up  entrenchments and wait the arrival of Colonel  Fry, with the remainder of the army, who would  hasten after him as soon as it should be ready for  marching. By this measure, it was expected that  if the French could not be driven from this station,  the hostile Indians would at least be overawed  into tranquillity; and any of the tribes that  still felt a predilection for the English, encouraged  to declare themselves.</p>

<p>The young hero lost no time in availing himself  of this permission, and something less than two  weeks found him encamped at a place called the  Great Meadows, a few miles eastward of the Laurel  Hill. Here finding an eligible position, he  determined to erect a fort, for the purpose of protecting  his horses and provisions, and also of securing  a retreat for his men in case of disaster.  This strength, from the haste and circumstances  under which it was erected, he called "Fort Necessity."</p>   

<p>While his soldiers were employed at this work,  being anxious to ascertain the real condition and  strength of the French garrison, and whether they  were apprised of his approach, he set out on foot,  accompanied by Vanbraam, both drest as Indians,  in order to reconnoitre their position. When he  arrived at Turtle Creek, he found that Paddy  Frazier had just come that very day from Du  Quesne, and was therefore able to give him all  the information he could wish. The circumstances<pb n="87"/> he reported, however, were not very encouraging.  The circumvallation of the Fort was not indeed  entirely finished on the sides towards the rivers,  nor had the garrison yet received any ordnance  from Le Boeuf; but a day or two before, a reinforcement  of nearly five hundred men had descended  the Alleghany river, and a large supply of cannon  and other warlike stores from Canada was  reported to be on its way, and daily expected.</p>

<p>With respect to Washington's approach and  intentions, Paddy rather believed that the French  were yet ignorant. At all events, he had heard  nothing said of them while he was in the garrison,  but he proposed to return the next morning, and  by some means to make himself more certain on  the subject.</p>

<p>During the evening, Washington had the pleasure  of enjoying in private, a short conversation  with the beloved of his soul; but he found her  heart as much averse to love as formerly, although  he pleaded his passion more energetically  and eloquently than ever. She, however,  with the view of soothing his wounded feelings,  and rendering her refusal of his proposals as little  oppressive upon his mind as possible, expressed  so warmly what she really felt, esteem for his  virtues, and admiration of his talents, that although  he forbore to urge her further, he could not forbear  to cherish some sweet hope that the day  might come when, even contrary to her own expectations,  she might feel---she might acknowledge,  that she loved him. Alas, he knew not  how intensely and steadfastly she loved another:  and alas, by her kind and amiable, but ill-judged  anxiety to save him from the mortification of  a harsh refusal, she prolonged those hopes with  which his soul was loth to part, and unintentionally,  encouraged that fallacy of expectation in<pb n="88"/> his bosom, which, because it was destructive of  his peace, she would have given any consideration  to remove.</p>

<p>In the morning, as Washington, in order to pass  the time which was now become heavy on his  hands, wandered along the bank of the river, his  steps almost involuntarily led him to the spot  where he first beheld Maria.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Here," said he, as he leaned against the  walnut tree, "here it was that, while standing in  this spot, that vision of light so unexpectedly  burst upon my view! There she sat, as fixed to  this place I listened to the tones of her enchanting  voice. Ah! I will never forget that moment  when she looked up and showed me a countenance  of more than mortal beauty, such a countenance  as my imagination in its romantic moments  had often attempted to depict, but had  never before seen, and till then, had despaired of  ever seeing. Oh! what varied sensations both of  joy and misery have I since sustained! But, alas,  little of joy appears now to be before me. I  might have been happy had I never seen her:  but no---thank heaven I have seen her, I have  conversed with her, although it has ruined my  peace; for such an idea, such a lovely idea, as  her image alone could impart to my soul, was necessary  to make me happy. She refuses me,  alas, but she esteems me, and the time may come  when her heart may be disposed to love; for  heaven surely could not have made her so essential  to my happiness, without ordaining her for  me!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, I could wish thy hopes to be better  founded," said a voice. He turned, and beheld  Tonnaleuka beside him.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Father, thou knowest the maiden," said<pb n="89"/> Washington. "Ah! tell me---thinkest thou, can  her heart ever be mine?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," replied the prophet, "the chances  are now against thee, but the fates may in the end  be favourable. I will neither desire thee to hope  nor to despair."</p>

<p>"But hear me, my son, there is a person concealed  in these woods from the enmity of the  French. He is of a generous and daring mind, a  Briton like thyself, and like thyself, a soldier. He  has heard of thy coming with an armed force, and  longs to join thee against the enemies of his country.  Wilt thou receive him?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"With great pleasure, and a hearty welcome,"  replied Washington---"May I ask his name?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Charles Adderly," returned the prophet.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I am glad of it," said Washington. "He is  a young man of indeed a gallant spirit, and will  be a real acquisition to me. I have often of late  wondered where he was concealed. I heard of  his rescue from the French, and could not think  he had made his way to Philadelphia, otherwise  it would have been publicly known. But where  shall I see him?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Let me first inquire when you intend returning  to your army?" said the prophet.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"To-night I believe; as it is moonlight, I think  I need not delay longer."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Then to-night, at ten o'clock, he shall here  meet you, if that hour answers," said Tonnaleuka.</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I shall make it answer," returned Washington.</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Then, farewell, my son," said the prophet,  and he disappeared in the direction of Turtle  Creek; and Washington returned to the house, to  enjoy the luxury of conversing with Maria, although  he knew that he must avoid the subject of<pb n="90"/> love. She had walked out, however, and he could  not ascertain, or at least he had too much delicacy  of feeling to inquire, in what direction; and he  passed rather a tedious and melancholy afternoon,  in company with Gilbert Frazier and Mr. Vanbraam.</p>
            </quote>   

<p>But although Washington did not find his beloved,  yet, reader, I will tell you where she had  gone. It was to the place where her heart was  treasured---the cavern of her lover. She had paid  several visits to this place of late, and had indulged  Charles in some very pleasing and interesting  interviews; but she had taken care never to mention  to him any thing concerning the addresses she  had received from Washington, as she conceived  that such information would only give him unnecessary  pain. Tonnaleuka had been equally guarded  on this subject, so that Charles had no conception  that the chief under whom he was about to  volunteer his services to his country was his rival;  and Washington, on his part, was altogether  ignorant that the young volunteer for whom he  felt such a high respect, was the only obstacle between  him and his soul's chief desire.</p>

<p>Tonnaleuka had, previous to his meeting with  Washington at the walnut tree, as we have just related,  informed Maria of Charles's wish to join  the troops at Fort Necessity. He had also informed  Charles of the vicinity of Washington, and did  not object to his joining him as he considered it to  be the safest and most elegible means by which  he could be relieved from his confinement, and  get out of the Wilderness. As to Maria she had  been always in the habit of offering no opposition  to whatever the prophet approved. The matter  was therefore decided on; and she now went to  the cavern in compliance with her lover's request  to see her before his departure.</p>

<pb n="91"/>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah, my love!" said he, as they conversed together,  "I almost feel inclined to reject that liberty,  and to forego that honourable service, which  is now open to me, since they will be purchased  at the dear rate of leaving thy vicinity, of depriving  myself of these sweet visits with which thou  hast made my asylum happy. Oh Maria! honour  calls me---but how can I think of removing so far  from thee?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Charles!" she replied, "I indeed feel uneasy  at the thought of your being again exposed to the  hazards of war. But it is perhaps your duty,  Tonnaleuka approves of it, and he knows better;  at least, he can judge more cooly on this matter  than I can. I pray that God may watch over your  safety---"</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"And oh!" he replied, "may he watch over  thine, thou lovely, but tender plant, whom I must  thus leave exposed to all the rude storms of a barbarous  forest!

            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It is a comfort to me," she replied, "that  you will be under such a chief. I know him, my  Charles---I have heard Tonnaleuka speak of his  qualities, and I am persuaded that if wisdom can  command success, and virtue deserve it, it will  follow his standard. But, oh Charles! he may  be successful, and yet thou be lost, lost to thy Maria.  Alas! alas! I cannot help trembling when I  think of the numerous accidents of war to which  thou wilt soon be exposed."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Fear not, my dearest, my best beloved!" said  Charles, much affected at this manifestation of her  concern for his safety. "Fear not---the God whom  thou servest, and who made thee so pure and so  lovely, will preserve me for thy sake."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="92"/>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I will never cease to pray fervently," she replied,  "that he may---and, although I cannot help  suffering fear lest misfortune should assail the betrothed  of my heart when he becomes so exposed  to danger, yet I will not distrust either the power  or goodness of that God, who, I know, is as able  to save in the whirlwind as in the calm. And, oh  Charles---may I conjure you never to cease to  trust in him, and implore him to be your guide, as  well as your guard."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Maria, my sweetest love!" said he, "it is  my duty to do so; and since thou desirest it, it  shall be my study, it shall be my pleasure, my---"</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, Charles!" she hastily replied; "I trust  that it has always been thy pleasure. Oh, say  not that it is to gratify me that you would make  it so."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Maria, hear me, my love!" said he; "I have  never yet been insensible to the delight that arises  from worshipping God, and I hope I never shall.  But to obey thy injunction is in itself a pleasure,  distinct and rapturous, which until my heart ceases  to beat it shall keenly feel; and even the first  of my duties, the worshipping of my God, shall  derive additional pleasure from thy commanding  it. Oh Maria! do not think me profane when I  say that religion appears to me more lovely when  it is recommended by thee."</p>
            </quote>

<p>They now heard the steps of Tonnaleuka advancing.</p>   

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My children," said he, as he entered, "you  are now about to separate. Let it be with fortitude  and resignation. The will of heaven respecing  you cannot be yet known. But repose confidence  in your Great Father, and serve him; and  whatsoever accidents may befall you, be assured  that, although they may produce temporary distress,  they will in the end result in your lasting<pb n="93"/> advantage. Such, such, will ever be the happy  fate of those who, amidst all trials, maintain their  integrity."</p>

<p>"This, my children, is my advice. I wish you  to attend to it."</p>

<p>"For you, my son, this night at ten o'clock  your chief will await your coming to the place  where I will conduct you. Be ready, therefore,  to meet him---and study to love and obey him, for  he is worthy of love and obedience. I would also  say, imitate his virtues; but they are inimitable."</p>

<p>"And now, my daughter," said he, to Maria---  "Bid this young man farewell, and come along  with me. I doubt not but heaven will again grant  you to meet, and perhaps at no distant period."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"God grant it," said Charles---"Then since it  must be so, farewell---farewell, my love!"---and  while he imprinted an ardent kiss upon her hand,  she returned a faint "farewell."</p>
            </quote>

<p>She then left the cavern with Tonnaleuka, who  accompanied her until within sight of her father's  house, where she arrived a little before sunset,  much to the gratification of Washington, who began  to fear that he might not see her before his departure;  and even felt his mind agitated with doubts  that she might have absented herself on account  of his presence."</p>

<p>He could not help, therefore, manifesting his  satisfaction at her return, by indulging in a sprightliness  and gaiety of conversation to which, during  the whole day, he had been a stranger.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Miss Frazier," said he, "I was beginning to  despair of seeing you before I set off. You seem  to be like the great huntress of the Grecian mythology,  who esteemed the shades for nothing so  much as their concealing her from the eyes of visiters."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="94"/>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I have always, in good weather," she replied,  "been fond of the woods, although I did not seek  them to-day, I assure you, for the purpose of  avoiding visiters; and with respect to those who  now honour us with their presence, they are the  last in the world towards whom I should be disposed  to act the part of the shy Diana. No, no, sir,  they stand too high in my estimation for that."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Notwithstanding which," returned Washington,  "you have for the last six hours at least, exclusively  favoured the rocks and the streams with  your company, to the great disappointment and  vexation of us your poor visiters, who have been  the whole afternoon fretting and pining so much  at your absence, that we could have wished ourselves  changed into rocks, and trees, and fountains,  if so we could have enjoyed your presence. But  it was perhaps as well, as we now enjoy it the  more sensibly, on account of having so severely  felt the want of it."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I am really glad that I can make any atonement  for my fault," replied she. "But methinks,  Mr. Washington, that if the company had suffered  so very much from my absence, it would hardly  exhibit the contented, good-humoured, and sprightly  countenances I now behold."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Ah, Miss Frazier!" returned Washington  "you know that the minds of men are variable;<pb n="95"/> and you have yourself seen plants drooping in the  rain, that have almost instantaneously erected  their heads, and become lively and gay in the sunshine."</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I acknowledge you have the advantage of me  in this respect," observed Washington. "I cannot  retort upon you; for I know no one of the  gods who ever thought of avoiding women, otherwise  I might eulogize his firmness, although I confess  that I would heartily condemn his taste. But,  alas! Miss Frazier, to speak seriously, it was cruel  to deprive me of your company to-day. My stay  here must be very short, and I wished to have all  my friends in this place around me while it lasted.  O! would to heaven that every member of this  family were now at Mount Vernon, safely removed  from the havoc and distress which barbarous  war has destined for this quarter of the country.

<p>Soon after this, Paddy returned from the garrison.  Washington walked out with him, and received the following intelligence.</p>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Some Indians have informed the Governor this very day," said he, "that you are approaching  with several hundred Virginians to attack the fort.

After holding councils of war, making  speeches, and drinking wine in abundance,  they at last resolved to detach about a hundred  men to watch your motions, impede your progress,  and send you to the devil, I suppose, if they can.

<l>Yet cautious as in foeman's land,</l>
<l>Lord Marnion's order speeds the band,</l>
<l>Some opener ground to gain;</l>
<l>And scarce a furlong had they rode,</l>

<l>A little woodland plain.</l>
<l>Just in that advantageous glade,</l>
<l>The halting troops a line had made,</l>
<l>As forth from the opposing shade</l>
<l>Issued a gallant train.</l>

<l><emph>Scott.</emph> </l>
</lg>

<p>Paddy continued to guide our party through  unfrequented paths, and often no paths at all,  amidst an uninterrupted and silent forest, and over  hills, and precipices, dingles, vales, ravines, and  creeks, until he deposited them in Fort Necessity,  a distance of nearly seventy miles, in little  more than twenty four hours after their leaving  Frazier's. During their journey they had neither  seen nor heard any thing of the French detachment,  nor had any intelligence concerning it reached  the Fort.</p>

<p>The whole of that night, however, Washington  took effectual measures to prevent a surprise, and  the next morning Paddy Frazier, together with  several other scouts were sent to range the country  in search of the enemy.</p>

<p>As a few days before, Washington had the misfortune  to lose by sickness, one of his officers, a  captain, named Stewart, he had now an opportunity  of manifesting his regard for Charles Adderly  by bestowing upon him the vacant commission. <pb n="100"/> Charles, therefore, now felt himself in that honourable  situation of life, which was perfectly suited  to his ardent and romantic disposition. He  was now a soldier, and an officer in the service  of his country, and under a leader who honoured  him with his friendship, and for whose pre-eminent  talents and virtues he was impressed with  the most profound admiration and respect.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock at night when Paddy  Frazier entered Washington's quarters, with information  concerning the enemy. He had discovered  them about mid-day, ascending the western  side of the Laurel Hill, and he kept them in view  the whole afternoon, until he saw them encamped  in a narrow defile several miles eastward of the  hill, and only about two hours march from the  Fort.</p>

<p>Paddy described the ground on which Jumonville  had encamped his men, in such a manner,  that Washington immediately perceived the practicability  of seizing, during the night, upon the  heights that surrounded them, and surprising them  into a surrender in the morning, perhaps, without  bloodshed. He accordingly, without delay, placed  himself at the head of about two hundred men,  and proceeded to the spot. It was on the margin  of a small brook, and consisted of a flat piece of  ground not more than fifty yards wide, covered on  both the east and west by high and abrupt hills,  which rendered it one of the best places that could  be found for concealment, but one of the worst  for escape.</p>

<p>After silently and cautiously reconnoitering the  ground, Washington detached nearly one half of  his troops under the charge of a trusty officer, by  a circuitous route through which they were guided  by Paddy Frazier, to take possession of the <pb n="101"/>  western height, while he himself with the remainder  occupied that on the east.</p>

<p>During the night his humanity prevented him  from attacking the French; for he reasonably expected  that when they should, in the morning, perceive  themselves so completely hemmed in by a superior  force, without any means left for either escape  or resistance, they would surrender without  giving occasion for unnecessary slaughter.</p>

<p>His expectations were, to a great extent, although  not altogether, realized. The French, indeed,  were much astonished when the dawn discovered  to their view the adjacent heights glittering  with the weapons of war, and the British colours  floating at intervals all around them. Their  commander, however, who was of a brave, but  rather rash temper, felt more chagrin and irritation,  than despondency at the circumstance. He  rejected Washington's summons to surrender at  discretion; and with the very forlorn expectation of  throwing the Virginians into some confusion  which might facilitate his escape, he ordered an  attack to be made upon a company which guarded  the lower entrance into the defile. This company  was under the charge of Charles Adderly,  beside whom Paddy Frazier happened then to  have stationed himself.</p>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Damn that scoundrel Jumonville!" cried Paddy, as soon as he observed these motions of the  French. "He'll sacrifice his men to his madness,  and give us trouble too. But I'll pop a ball into  his cap, to teach him sobriety."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The next instant Paddy's rifle was at his eye,  and Jumonville's brains were scattered on the  ground. The attack in consequence of this accident  was suspended, and, after some little parlying,  the French surrendered themselves <pb n="102"/> unconditionally prisoners of war, and were soon lodged in  Fort Necessity.</p>

<p>The sun of prosperity seemed for several days  to brighten more and more upon the British cause.  The day after capturing the French detachment,  the remainder of the Virginian regiment, that was  to follow under Colonel Fry, joined their companions;  but the Colonel had died on the march,  and, very much to the satisfaction of all his soldiers,  the sole command now devolved upon Washington.  The number of his troops was also augmented  a few days afterwards, by the arrival of  two regular companies, one from the colony of  New-York, and the other from South Carolina;  for by this time all the colonies had become interested  in the struggle, and resolved to support Virginia  in her efforts against the common enemy.</p>

<p>Having now a force of nearly six hundred men,  tolerably well appointed with every material for war  except cannon, of which, however, he knew that Du  Quesne was also destitute, Washington resolved to  proceed westward to the attack of that post, or if  that should be found imprudent, to cut off whatever  supplies might be sent to its aid from Le  Boeuf or Canada. At the very worst, he conceived  that he could at least seize upon some favourable  position which he might fortify, as a countervailing  strength, and where he could maintain his  ground, and keep the enemy in check, until he  should be reinforced from the east. A scarcity of  provisions, which began to be felt in his little  army, was the only thing that gave him uneasiness,  and seemed to call for a postponement of his design.  But he trusted that a supply would soon  follow him, as he had expressly and urgently written  to Governor Dinwiddie on the subject; and  he feared much that even a short delay might <pb n="103"/> allow the Canadian reinforcements to enter Du  Quesne, and thereby ruin every prospect he might  have of dislodging the enemy from thence, for that  campaign.</p>

<p>In the mean time, he knew that Paddy Frazier,  who had returned to his father's the day succeeding  the capture of Jumonville's party, was keeping  an active and vigilant eye upon the proceedings  of the French. He therefore felt confident that  they could take no step of importance, or receive  any considerable accession of force, without his  obtaining the speediest intelligence possible on the  subject. So long as Paddy was silent, he had, in  consequence, a right to presume that the French  were yet unrecruited and inactive.</p>

<p>These reflections, and his extreme solicitude to  clear that quarter of the country of the French,  induced him to proceed; and about the latter end  of June, he commenced his march westward with  all the troops he had, except one company, which  was left to protect the fort from any surprise. On  the second day of their march, however, when  they had proceeded only a few miles to the westward  of the Laurel Hill, Paddy Frazier met them  with intelligence of such a nature as to stop their  further progress.</p>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>He said, that "the French having only two days  before received their long-expected supplies from  Canada, had already, with a force of nearly a thousand  Europeans and as many Indians, commenced  their march to meet the British, and could not be  more than half a day's journey distant."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Under the circumstances in which his army was  then placed, Washington considered that this was  indeed alarming intelligence. Their bread was  altogether exhausted, and their supply of meat was  become very scanty. If the French should by  any means get to the eastward of them, which, by <pb n="104"/> the aid of the Indians, who were well acquainted  with the country, and their own superior numbers,  they might easily do, any supply of provisions or  other stores that might be sent from Virginia,  would inevitably be intercepted, unless convoyed  by a stronger escort than there was any reason to  expect would accompany it.</p>

<p>As, however, Washington was very reluctant to  commence a retrograde motion solely on his own  responsibility, however necessary it might be, he  thought proper to call a council of war, before  which he laid all the circumstances of their situation,  and his own opinion as to the necessity of  a retreat.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"God is my witness," said he, in concluding his  address to the council, "that there is no one here  who feels more reluctant to embrace such a measure  than I do. My whole heart has become bent  on relieving this country from the influence of the  French; for while they rule here, I know well  that Indian outrages will never cease to afflict  our frontiers, and entail upon our back-settlers a  precarious and wretched existence. But we must,  at present, yield to the imperious mandate of fate.  The force of the enemy is overwhelming. In  Fort Necessity we may be able to defend ourselves  until our friends send us succours, which we have  every reason to expect cannot now be long delayed."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Thus, gentlemen, I have laid before you the  real nature of our situation, and the measures  which it appears to me the preservation of our  troops require us to pursue. I now submit it to  your decision, whether to adopt the disagreeable  alternative of returning to our fort, which I have  recommended, or of pushing forward or remaining  where we are, and thereby tempt destruction, <pb n="105"/> either from the hand of the enemy, or the more  terrible one of famine."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The council, after a very short deliberation, resolved  unanimously that a retreat was necessary,  to afford them any chance of avoiding capture or  destruction. It was therefore immediately commenced;  and Fort Necessity saw them again enter  its ramparts, about four days after they had  left it.</p>

<p>There was only one individual in the whole  band who felt the disappointment occasioned by  this unfortunate turn of affairs, as acutely as Washington  himself, and he did so because his feelings  arose from the same cause: this was Captain Adderly.  With hopes highly elated in his breast, he  had expected in a few days to have been again  stationed beside his Maria, not as an absconder,  who feared to show his head above ground, but as  an avowed soldier of his country, able to protect  the object of his affection from any species of insult,  whether offered by christian or savage. Now  he had to retreat from the superior force of that  enemy, whose control in the country was the only  obstacle to his happiness.</p>

<p>Washington's feelings ran much in the same  strain, only he had an additional burthen of public  solicitude and grief for the miseries to which  he saw that thousands of his countrymen would,  in consequence of his failure in this enterprise, be  doomed. He, however, even at this early period  of his career, began to practise, in an extraordinary  manner, the virtue of self-command, for  which he afterwards became so remarkable. At  this time, when his heart's tender affections were  undoubtedly stronger and more tried than ever  they were during any subsequent period of his life,  when he cherished an ardent desire to be near his  Maria, and to perform every thing that promised <pb n="106"/> to secure her safety during these times of trouble  and peril, he never permitted her idea for one instant  to interfere with his duty to his country.  No; although no man ever loved woman more  fervently and tenderly than he loved Maria, yet  still his country was the mistress to whose service,  whenever she pleased to call upon him, he resolved  to devote himself in preference to any other.</p>

<p>As he expected soon to sustain an attack at the  post he now occupied, he kept his men busily employed  in improving its strength. Its defences,  which were of the stoccade kind, had been hastily  erected, and were very incomplete, and he had  not yet been able to deepen its trench sufficiently  to offer much obstacle to the enemy. His troops  were all zealous, however, in obeying his directions,  and exerted themselves so industriously, that  every hour appeared to add to their security. The  officers themselves made great personal exertions  on this occasion, and with great alacrity set the  common men an example of manual labour.</p>

<p>Among others, Charles Adderly had one day  wrought very perseveringly at the trench, when  feeling fatigued towards the evening, and wishing  to enjoy, for a short space, the luxury of meditating  in solitude upon Maria, he descended a  steep declivity, at a small distance from the fort, to  the edge of a brook which there worked its silent  passage beneath a verdant covering of hazels  and alder bushes.</p>

<p>On a small grassy bank he threw himself down,  beneath a canopy formed by the intertwining  branches of these shrubs, the luxuriant foliage of  which scarcely permitted the rays of the sun, at  that time setting in great magnificence, to reach  him. But if they had reached him, all-glorious  and strikingly beautiful as the appearance of that  luminary then was, it could not have attracted his <pb n="107"/> attention---for that attention was now firmly riveted  upon an object to him more attractive, lovely,  and endearing, than any other created being he  could behold.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Alas," thought he; "and am I doomed to be  cut off from her presence? Is she fated thus to  reside within the reach and under the power of an  enemy, whose outrageous and ruffian tempers are  but too well known? Ah! what troubles and persecutions  will she have to suffer, if her enchanting  beauties should happen to excite the passions of  any of these lawless and unrestrained Frenchmen?  Oh, my God! there is distraction, there is frenzy  in the idea. Heaven preserve her from such  trials!"</p>

<quote rend="Frenchman"><p>"Ah, then, you don't like Frenchmen, don't  you?" exclaimed a voice suddenly; and before  he had time to get on his feet, two men had rushed  upon him.

<p>That instant the suspended Frenchman was  dashed violently upon the ground, and the next  his own dagger was buried in his heart.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I will have you," said Charles, "to throw  down that weapon, and catch him by the shoulder  or the neck, if you think proper, only don't  strangle him, and push him before you to the fort  yonder, where we will dispose of him as may be  found suitable."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Peter leapt upon the captive as a tiger would  upon his prey, and seizing him by the collar with  his right hand, drove him before him in great triumph,  occasionally giving him a shake, and a kick  upon the breech with his knee, while the Frenchman,  very much to the delight of his tormentor,  roared out piteously for mercy.</p>

<p>Upon his examination at the fort, the prisoner  acknowledged that he and his slain companion  had been sent forward, by Monsieur De Villiers,  who was at the head of an army of French and  Indians, amounting to nearly two thousand men,  to reconnoitre the position and strength of the  British under colonel Washington; and that they  had the whole of that day been concealed in the  hollow where they had fallen in with captain Adderly,  and only waited for the coming of night to  approach nearer the works, and explore them  more minutely. He also stated that the French <pb n="109"/>  army could not be far distant; and if they did not  delay for the return of their spies, they might advance  to attack the fort the next day.</p>

<p>To account for the unexpected and timely approach  of Peter M`Fall to his master's rescue, I  must inform the reader that Mr. Gist, to whose  house it will be remembered, he had been conveyed  by Paddy Frazier for the purpose of keeping  him out of the way of mischief, understanding  that provisions were scarce, and consequently  dear at the fort, had, while the main body of  the troops were absent on the excursion that has  been mentioned, visited the garrison in order to  dispose of some of the productions of his farm,  and had been there informed of Charles Adderly's  situation in the army. He communicated  this intelligence to Peter, who immediately resolved  to rejoin his master. He accordingly bade a  tender adieu to the fair Esther Gist, whose charms  had made him forget those of Molly M`Nickle, and  starting for Fort Necessity, which was not more  than fifteen or sixteen miles distant, arrived,  as we have seen, just at the critical moment to  save his master from destruction. He at once  resumed, very much to the satisfaction of both  parties, his old station as the faithful and favourite  servant of Charles Adderly.</p>

<p>The information which the captured Frenchman  had given of the vicinity of the enemy, was  found the next morning to be correct. The day  had scarcely dawned, when Washington received  intelligence from some of the out-posts that the  hostile standards were approaching, and that the  woods to a considerable extent, seemed to be  alive with French and Indians. The garrison was  immediately under arms, and every man at his station,  expecting a severe conflict, but resolved to  do his duty, so that if the enemy should prevail,  they should pay dear for their victory. Their  defences were far from being complete. The  trench had not been altogether cut round the  stoccade, in a few places it was barely marked  out, and in none was it so deep as to be an effectual  barrier to the assailants. The stoccade was  itself very imperfect in many places, there being  yet several gaps entirely destitute of stakes. The  hostile force was at least three to one, and was  equally well appointed in all the implements of <pb n="111"/> war. But brave men, although they may see danger,  never lose courage; and Washington with  great promptitude and coolness, made such judicious  arrangements for receiving the assailants,  that confidence was inspired in every one of his  men, and even hopes of victory began to actuate  their bosoms. In order to animate them still  more, their heroic commander, after each company  had received its instructions, and taken its  station, addressed to it a short speech, reminding  the soldiers that upon their valour and good conduct  that day, the safety of a thousand innocent  Christian families upon the frontiers depended.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Think," said he, in some of these short addresses,  "on the consequence of our being defeated  on this occasion. Hordes of merciless  savages will be let loose upon your defenceless  wives and children, who will riot in their destruction,  and will, ere they send their miserable victims  to eternity, inflict on them every species of  torture they can invent. Oh, I therefore conjure  you, my fellow-soldiers, to be steady and strong  to-day, and if possible, save your country, and her  children, from such calamities."</p>
</quote>

<p>As the enemy was advancing in a direction  where the ditch was, to a considerable extent,  between four and five feet deep, Captain Adderly  was there stationed with about a hundred  marksmen, who were instructed to conceal themselves  by remaining in a stooping posture until  their adversaries approached so near that there  would be no danger of their fire missing them,  when they should open it with as sure and steady  an aim as possible. Each of these marksmen  was supplied, in addition to his rifle, with a loaded  musket, so that the party could without intermission,  pour upon their enemies two successive  discharges; or if it should be necessary, <pb n="112"/> meet them at the point of the bayonet. The remainder  of the troops kept within the stoccade,  ready also to give the foe a fiery and deadly salute,  whenever he should venture near enough.</p>

<p>These dispositions on the part of the Virginians,  were scarcely made, when the savage warwhoop  was heard between nine and ten o'clock  in the morning, and at the distance of about six  hundred yards from the ditch, the enemy halted,  and a volley from a thousand muskets was instantly  poured upon the stoccade. Some of the badly  fixed piles were overthrown, and five or six of  the Virginians killed by this discharge. They,  however, coolly reserved their fire for some minutes,  until the assailants, encouraged by this forbearance,  advanced rapidly to within about a  hundred yards of the ditch, when captain Adderly  gave a preconcerted signal to his marksmen,  and that instant a hundred Frenchmen pressed  the ground. They paused for a moment, and  were inclined to fall back, but De Villiers supposing  the Virginian rifles to be now unloaded,  urged them forward to storm the fort, when they  were again saluted by a volley from both the ditch  and the stoccade, which levelled nearly a hundred  and fifty more of them to the earth.</p>

<p>De Villiers now conceived it prudent to avoid  that fatal ditch, and attack the fort in an other  quarter. He accordingly drew off his men from  the reach of the Virginian fire, which movement  allowed Adderly's marksmen an opportunity to  reload unmolested. The enemy now keeping at  a respectful distance from the fort, marched towards  its southeast quarter, where they hoped to  find it more easily assailable. But when opposite  this quarter, although they perceived its ramparts  to be less complete than elsewhere, yet being ignorant  of the depth of the ditch that fronted it, <pb n="113"/>  they for several hours, manifested a shyness to  approach, lest similar volleys to those they had so  fatally experienced from Adderly's men, should  issue from it. They, however, kept up an irregular  and very inefficient fire from behind the shelter  of trees and long grass, upon the garrison,  which the latter seemed to take very coolly and  patiently, never returning it except when some of  the Indians or French came within hitting distance  of their marksmen.</p>

<p>Towards the after part of the day, as if this apparent  contempt shewn by the garrison, had at last  roused and irritated him to greater boldness and  energy of action, De Villiers came rapidly on with  his whole force, seemingly resolved to take the  place, cost what it would. But here, also, captain  Adderly's marksmen lay in wait for him. They  discharged their rifles, as before, but the enemy  had not come in such a compact body, and therefore,  although they lost a number of men, and  were for a moment made to recoil, they soon recovered  their order, and pushed forward regardless  of danger. Even a second volley, although  it told fatally upon them, was not sufficient to check  their progress, as their whole force, Indians as  well as French, seemed to be inspired with an absolute  contempt of destruction.</p>

<p>In a minute, the enemy had gained the edge of  the ditch, and the rifles of Adderly's men were unloaded;  but their bayonets were fixed, and a  cheveaux-de-frise of that formidable weapon instantly  presented itself against them, over which  it was impossible for the French to proceed.</p>

<p>About a hundred bayonets, however, could not  defend the whole trench against such a number of  enemies as now assailed it, and several strong parties  of the French were, in a moment, at other  points attempting to cross it. These were <pb n="114"/> instantly attacked with a heavy fire from the stoccade,  notwithstanding which, upwards of five hundred,  led on by De Villiers in person, had succeeded in  descending into the ditch, and would, perhaps,  have made their way into the fort, had not Washington  promptly charged them, at the head of  about one hundred and fifty men, with fixed bayonets,  before they could ascend to the level  ground. This charge was assisted at a very critical  moment by a well directed fire from the NewYorkers,  who were stationed within the stoccade.  De Villiers, was, in consequence, obliged to withdraw,  after leaving between fifty and sixty of his  men dead on the spot.</p>

<p>Captain Adderly, much about the same time,  had driven off the party with which he had been  engaged. Not content, however, with this advantage,  his impetuosity induced him to follow the  enemy upon the open space. He accordingly  sprang out of the trench, and calling on his men  to follow him, he was obeyed. The enemy, who  were at least three to one against him, turned  upon him, and his small band would, in all probability,  have been cut to pieces, had not Washington  perceived their danger, and with the hundred  and fifty Virginians that had driven off De  Villiers, flew to their aid, and the enemy thought  proper to retire to the shelter of the woods, which  they did in tolerably good order; not, however,  before Captain Adderly and Monsieur Joncaire  had met in single combat, and the latter had been  hewn to the earth, receiving a dreadful fracture in  the skull, of which he died a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>Both Washington's and Adderly's parties now  returned to their old stations, as pursuing a hostile  force upon exposed ground, who were so much their  superior in number, and as well furnished for <pb n="115"/> battle as themselves, would have been absolute  madness.</p>

<p>A cessation of the attack now took place, and  Washington had time to inquire into the real posture  of affairs. Between sixty or seventy of his  men were killed, and upwards of a hundred so badly  wounded as to be incapable of service. The  enemy were repulsed, it is true, but there was every  probability that the attack would be renewed the  next day; and if the assailants should happen to  direct their force to the quarter where the shallowness  of the trench would permit them easily  to pass, the fort must fall. If, on the other hand,  they should be too much intimidated by the warm  reception they had just received, to renew their  attempt to storm the place, and should content  themselves with blockading it, and cutting off its  expected supplies, the surrender of the garrison  must be equally, nay, perhaps more inevitably  certain, as it did not possess, at that moment, more  than three days scanty allowance of provisions.</p>

<p>The only chance of extrication from these difficulties,  Washington conceived would be a renewal  of the attack by the enemy upon the same  points on which they had already made it. This  would afford his troops an opportunity of again repulsing  the assailants, and perhaps compelling  them to abandon the enterprise. It was, therefore,  his great object to prevent them from discovering  the weak parts of his defence; and he accordingly  ordered that, during the night, these should  be particularly guarded from the approach of spies  and reconnoiterers.</p>

<p>While he was making arrangements for preventing  a surprise, a trumpeter approached from the  French, who were encamping in the woods, about  eight or nine hundred yards distant, demanding a <pb n="116"/> parley, and permission for an officer to enter the  fort in order to negotiate for its surrender.</p>

<p>Washington promptly refused to grant the last  request. He declared that he would permit none  of the enemy to enter the fort without detaining  him there as a prisoner; and that if the French  commander was serious in his desire to negotiate,  he must give a passport for a British officer to proceed  to his camp for the purpose, and also his  written parole for his safe return. Washington's  caution in this matter arose from his unwillingness  to expose the incompleteness of his works to  any of the enemy, and it also occurred to him that  this request for negotiation might be a contrivance  of De Villier's to discover any assailable quarter  for a new attack.</p>

<p>De Villiers, however, granted the parole required,  and Captain Adderly was appointed to wait  upon him, and ascertain the terms he had to  propose. These terms being very little short of  absolute surrender, were quite inadmissable; and  Washington instructed Charles to "inform the  French commander, that unless he greatly humbled  his views, and moderated his pretensions, an  attempt to negotiate was only useless trouble, and  should be no longer attended to."</p>

<p>This reply induced Villiers to conceive that the  British were more confident of being able to resist  him than he expected. He therefore in a  second message, did lower his tone considerably,  offering to permit the garrison, both officers and  privates, on giving their parole not to serve in this  country again during the continuation of the present  contest, against the French, or their allies,  permission to return to their several homes, with  such provisions as were necessary for their journey,  but without any of their arms or military  stores.</p>
<pb n="117"/>
<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Tell Monsieur De Villiers," said Washington,  after hearing these proposals, "that he very much  mistakes both our situation and our dispositions,  if he calculates on our accepting such terms.---  The only terms I shall accept are these,---That  we shall be allowed the honours of war, permitted  to retain our arms, baggage, and stores of every  kind; and also to take our own time to march without  molestation back to Virginia.---Rather than  capitulate on any other conditions, I shall bury  myself and every man who shall adhere to me,  amidst the ruins of our Fort. De Villiers need  not, therefore, trouble me with any other answer  than an acceptance of these terms."</p></quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>When Captain Adderly reported this reply to  De Villiers, "that young Washington is an obstinate  commander," said he, "but I see he is a  brave one;---and I believe I can make nothing  more of him, without considerable slaughter.---  Let him have his terms, therefore, in the name of  heaven, so that I may get him out of this part of  the country."</p></quote>

<p>The capitulation was accordingly drawn up in  French, and afterwards translated into English,  when it was signed by the officers on both sides.---  The next morning the British removed all their  stores out of the fort, and with their colours flying,  their music playing, and the troops marching in military  array, they evacuated it, and paraded at some  distance beyond the French encampment.</p>

<p>As their horses were chiefly either killed or  captured during the engagement, they were unable  to carry off all their stores. They, therefore,  to prevent them from falling into the hands  of the French, destroyed the greater portion, preserving  only what they could bear away on their  shoulders. They then continued their march  homewards, and in about three days after leaving <pb n="118"/> Fort Necessity, arrived at the inhabited parts of  Virginia.</p>

<p>All ranks of Colonel Washington's countrymen  were highly pleased with the bravery and good  conduct he had displayed during these transactions;  and, indeed, the whole party received  great applause for their spirited and gallant behaviour.  When the legislature met, they expressed  their satisfaction at what had been done,  by presenting a sum of money to be distributed  among the soldiers, and passing a vote of thanks  to Colonel Washington and the officers under his  command, for the credit which their conduct had  reflected on their country.</p>

<p>To this vote of thanks, Washington, in the name  of the officers, made the following reply:</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"We, the officers of the Virginia regiment, are  highly sensible of the particular mark of distinction  with which you have honoured us in returning  your thanks for our behaviour in the late action;  and cannot help testifying our grateful acknowledgments  for your "high sense" of what we  shall always esteem a duty to our country and the  best of kings."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Favoured with your regard, we shall zealously  endeavour to deserve your applause, and by  our future actions strive to convince the worshipful  house of burgesses how much we esteem their  approbation, and, as it ought to be, regard it as  the voice of our country."</p>
            </quote>

    <quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Signed for the whole corps,   GEO. WASHINGTON."</p>
            </quote>
    
<pb n="119"/> <p>yet, shortly after this, some untoward circumstances  took place, which induced him to relinquish  it for the present, and to retire to a private station. These were owing to a controversy which  arose between the officers commissioned by the  king, and those commissioned only by the governors  of the colonies, concerning rank, the former  claiming precedence over the latter of the same  grade, when acting together in the same service.  I shall not here enter into the merits of this controversy,  which is detailed fully in the histories of  the times, and which was one cause among many  others that prevented more effectual measures  from being taken against the French during the  remainder of this campaign.</p>

<p>Colonel Washington and Captain Adderly took  part with the provincial officers in the discussion  of this matter; and as those holding commissions  from the crown at length carried their point, these  two gentlemen retired from the service, and many  of the Virginian officers followed their example.  Governor Dinwiddie addressed several letters to  Washington, pressing him still to hold his commission,  in reply to which he asserted his unabated  attachment for military employments, and his undiminished  desire to serve his country when she  needed him---"But," said he, "I can only serve  with pleasure, when it is in my power to do so  without dishonour."</p>

<p>He indeed perceived that his remaining in the  service at this time would be attended with very  little advantage to the public; for although Great  Britain had now declared war against the enemy,  and large European succours were expected soon  to arrive in the colonies, yet the councils of the  latter were so distracted, and their resources so  badly managed, that it was easy to see that no <pb n="120"/> enterprise of importance would be undertaken  against the French this season.</p>

<p>De Villiers, indeed, had on his part given occasion  for none; for, satisfied with having driven  Washington out of the Wilderness, and, perhaps,  conceiving it imprudent to maintain a station so  near the borders of the British settlements as Fort  Necessity, he relinquished it the very day after its  capture, and retraced his steps back to Fort Du  Quesne.</p>

<p>Some Indian ravages, it is true, were towards  the latter part of the season, committed on the  back-settlers of Virginia and Pennsylvania; but,  considering the failure of Washington's expedition,  the frontiers suffered infinitely less than might  have been expected. That very expedition, it is  presumed, although it had failed in its primary  object, had given both the French and the Indians  such a severe sample of what they would receive  from British vengeance, if they should arouse it,  by too much provocation, to the exertion of its  full strength, that they thought proper to exercise  some caution and forbearance towards them, at  least until the season should be so far advanced,  that the colonial troops could not again take the  field. It may be also mentioned, that, after  Washington's resignation, one Colonel Innes obtained  the command of the Virginia regiment,  which being recruited and joined by several companies  of regulars from Maryland and North Carolina,  presented to the view of the Indians a force  which, although it undertook the performance of  nothing important, was still sufficient to keep them  in such awe as to restrain their depredations.</p>

<p>Although the court of London, as soon as it  found that reasoning would have no effect in causing  that of Versailles to relinquish its claims upon  the Ohio country, did not hesitate to draw the <pb n="121"/>  sword in order to accomplish that end; yet no  European troops were sent to assist the colonies  to drive the intruders off the contested ground for  several months after the war was declared, and  during the whole of the autumn of 1754 and the  following winter, the French remained unmolested  in the possession of the Wilderness.</p>

<p>The family of Frazier continued as usual to follow  their employments undisturbed by the French,  with whom Paddy managed to keep on the most  cordial footing. The assistance he had rendered  Washington never became suspected, and both  he and Dr. Killbreath continued to trade with  them and the Indians as freely, and with as little  fear, as if they had never taken any part with  their enemies. As to the Indians, the friendship  of Tonnaleuka secured theirs to the family, and  except the disappointment which Gilbert felt from  the bad success of his countrymen, he had, on this  occasion, no cause for uncasiness; at least he felt  none from apprehension of either his own security  or that of his family.</p>

<p>With respect to Maria's feelings on hearing of  the transactions at Fort Necessity, the uncertainty  under which she laboured concerning Charles  Adderly's fate, gave her great uneasiness, but that  uneasiness was confined to her own breast. Perhaps  on that very account it was the more painful;  and, although she was not without hopes,  still her fears of some misfortune having taken  place would sometimes amount almost to agony,  and she would have given any consideration to be  assured of his safety; nay, such is often the intolerable  nature of suspense, that, if the worst had  happened, she would have made almost any sacrifice  to know it. At length fortune had compassion  upon her, and relieved her anxiety by throwing  in her way a Philadelphia newspaper, which <pb n="122"/> Paddy had procured from an Indian who had  wrapped it round some articles of spoil, of which  he had plundered one of the Pennsylvanian settlers  on the frontiers, about the latter end of autumn,  when several marauding parties of the savages,  as has been observed, ventured to make a  few predatory excursions. This paper contained  the following paragraph, which communicated joy  to her soul.</p>

<quote rend="News Article"><p>"It is with great pleasure that we announce the  arrival in our city of that gallant young man,  Charles Adderly, who commanded the party sent  out in the beginning of last winter, to take possession  of the lands belonging to the Ohio Company,  in our western wilderness, and upon which the  French garrison of Le Boeuf committed the daring  outrage which has been often mentioned in our  paper in terms of indignation, and which we rejoice  that our mother country has at length determined  to chastise, in a manner becoming her rank  and dignity among the nations."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="News Article"><p>"Mr. Adderly's friends had been for several  months uncertain of his fate, and their joy on being  again blessed with the society of one so much valued  and beloved, after he had, as many supposed,  fallen a victim to savage revenge and cruelty, will  not be easily imagined. This gentleman's adventures  in the western wilderness, during the last  winter, we are informed, have been of the most  singular and romantic character. Until the appearance  of the gallant Washington in that quarter  gave him an opportunity of joining his countrymen,  he owed his safety only to concealment in  the lonely dells and darksome caverns that abound  in that dreary wild. Great, indeed, must have  been his sufferings, and miraculous his escapes,  during the inclement season he was obliged to  seek shelter in such lurking-places."</p>

    <pb n="123"/>

<quote rend="News Article"><p>"We trust that Mr. Adderly, or some of his  friends, will one day favour the public with a narrative  of his adventures, during his excursions to  the west. We are persuaded that there are none  but would feel extremely interested in the perusal  of such a work."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The information thus obtained having tranquillized  Maria's mind concerning her lover's safety,  and no accident of a serious nature occurring to  her during the winter, she passed it with as much  satisfaction and ease of mind as in Charles's absence  could be reasonably expected. This absence,  however, it must not be denied, occasioned  her many an hour's anxious meditation; and  when in good weather she would take a ramble  through her native woods, often would the recollection  of her Charles's image melt her into tenderness.  On such occasions, often did she recall  to her thoughts the beautiful lines of Shenstone,  with a very slight alteration, so descriptive of her  own feelings:</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no class of beings in the  world more apt to be tormented with incidents  that are at cross-purposes with their wishes, than  lovers. It would be easy to prove the truth of  this assertion by a thousand examples; but it  would be too tedious a business. I shall, therefore,  not prove it all, unless the following statement of  some perplexities that befell Charles Adderly  shortly after his return to Philadelphia, be received  as a proof.</p>

<p>The joy of his father and mother on seeing their  only son, whom they looked upon almost as if he  had been restored from the grave, once more safe  under their roof, was such as tender parents will  readily conceive. They in a few days invited a  large party of their numerous friends, for the  friends of the rich are always numerous, to a splendid  ball and supper, in celebration of the joyful  occasion. This brilliant party consisted of some  of the most distinguished and fashionable families  then in Philadelphia. Its ladies in particular comprised  almost all that was beautiful, gay, and <pb n="125"/>  engaging in the city; but amidst the whole fascinating  group, there was one object whom every eye  singled out as the most worthy of admiration.  This was Miss Arabella Walworth, niece and heiress  to Robert Walworth, Esq. reputed to be the  most opulent banker in America. This young  lady had been the only child of John Walworth,  a West India merchant, who died in Jamaica about  ten years before her appearance in the gay assembly  of which we are speaking, and had left her the  sole heiress of a property said to amount to between  thirty and forty thousand pounds sterling.  She had lost her mother about three years afterwards,  and her uncle, the banker, had for the last  seven been her only guardian and protector.</p>

<quote rend="Robert Walworth"><p>Charles's father had long contemplated this  young lady as an eligible match for his son, and had  even gone so far as to secure the banker's acquiescence.  Although the old gentlemen had thus  easily arranged the matter between themselves,  they had not as yet imparted their scheme to the  young people; and Mr. Adderly now thought that  it would be but fair to give them an opportunity of  getting fond of each other, by which means the  match would be rendered much more agreeable,  and easily effected. Mr. Walworth, who knew  little about the influence of the tender passions,  being one of those cold-blooded, good sort of honest  money-making men, who never feel any of  the sweeter and more endearing impulses of life,  would have gone less ceremoniously to work, and  would have had the deeds of matrimony signed,  sealed, and delivered without delay; "for," said  he, in reply to some observation of old Adderly,  recommending a more cautious mode of proceeding,  "I can see no objection that the parties to this  contract can have to perfecting its obligation, <pb n="126"/> since they must, each of them, on the first inspection,  be convinced of getting value received. But  as it is a kind of business in which I have no experience,  being now in my fifty-ninth year, without  having ever bargained for a wife, I will leave it to  your management, for you must know better what  is needful to be done in the premises. Only I  wish you to make every reasonable despatch, lest,  by keeping the bargain in suspense, Arabella may  miss a profitable market."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"There is no danger of that," replied Charles's  father; "your niece, you may be assured, will for  these ten years to come, be as disposable a commodity  as any of her kind in the province. But  you may depend on it, Mr. Walworth, that I too  anxiously wish her to become my daughter-in-law,  to delay its accomplishment any longer than the  nature of the transaction will require."</p>
            </quote>

<p>On the night of the ball already mentioned,  Charles's father and mother used every contrivance  in their power to draw the attention of the  young pair towards each other.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Mother"><p>"The greatest favourite I have in the room,"  would his mother observe, "and, I believe, the  best young lady in the city, is Miss Walworth."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"I have always thought her an uncommonly fine  girl," would his father reply; "eminently beautiful  and accomplished, and mistress of nearly forty  thousand pounds in ready money, besides her expectations  from the banker. Charles, I shall be  glad if you secure this young lady for your partner  to-night."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"If she will consent to it," replied Charles very  complaisantly, "I shall do so; for I really believe  her to be a very amiable young woman."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"And don't you think her also handsome?"  asked the father.</p>
            </quote>


    <pb n="127"/>
    

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Very much so," replied the son, carelessly.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Have you ever seen any woman you thought more so?" said the father.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"That is rather an embarrassing question," returned Charles, in some confusion, for he thought  of his Maria; "I request time to reflect on an answer."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Well, Charles, no matter about an answer; I  wish to see her your partner to-night, at any rate,"  observed his father.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"If it be in my power, sir," said Charles, "you  shall be gratified."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He accordingly did, in the most polite manner,  request the fair lady to dance with him, and was  honoured with her compliance; and many a gallant  youth that night envied his felicity.</p>

<p>Charles, indeed, found her society during the  whole evening extremely agreeable and interesting;  and his native politeness towards the sex, independent  of a wish to gratify his father, induced  him to pay her the most pointed attention. But  even at that moment, the image of the sweet maid  of the Wilderness reigned triumphant in his soul;  and as he reflected that, while he was thus surrounded  with splendour and enjoyment, she might  be a prey to misfortune, perhaps the victim of lawless  passion and barbarity, he became thoughtful,  and more than once, in the midst of his gaiety and  mirth, heaved a sigh, which his father, who observed  all his attentions to Miss Walworth, perceived  with great satisfaction, as an indication that she  had already made some impression upon his heart.</p>

<p>As to the young lady, she, unfortunately for her  own peace, drew a similar conclusion. She saw  Charles Adderly; she had heard of his military  exploits, as they had been eulogised in the official  communications of Washington. He was just  such a man, he was just such a hero, as she <pb n="128"/> wished should love her; and she felt, from this night  she too unequivocally felt, that she loved him.</p>

<p>But, although in every respect admirable and  highly finished, both in beauty and accomplishments,  yet, even if his heart had been disengaged,  she was not exactly the character that Charles Adderly  could have loved. Her manner seemed rather  to challenge and claim admiration and homage  by an assumption of dignity, and a display of conscious  superiority, than to attract and warm into  fondness by an irresistible combination of faultless  loveliness, unaffected sweetness, amiable humility,  and the thousand nameless and bewitching graces  that shone from both the person and the mind of  Maria Frazier.</p>

<p>Charles, however, was pleased with the preference  which this high beauty of the world of fashion  in his native city manifested for him, on this evening,  over the many agreeable young men who fluttered  round her, and sighed to obtain from her an  approving smile.</p>

<p>As they sat together during an interval of dancing,  a young man named Morley, of good connexions  and large property in the city, who had  been long enamoured of Miss Walworth, and had  lately made some unrequited declarations of his  passion, approached and saluted them. Charles,  who had formerly been intimate with this young  man, invited him to sit beside them.</p>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"Perhaps my presence will only spoil the agreeable  import of your conversation," said Morley,  looking rather discontentedly at the lady.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"If you think so, sir," she replied, "you know  what best becomes you to do. I presume Mr.  Morley has more good-breeding than to offer his  presence where he imagines it is not wanted."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"I beg pardon, Miss Walworth," he replied;  "it was only my fears of being an intruder that <pb n="129"/> suggested the idea. I hope Captain Adderly does  not conceive me one. If he says the word, I shall  retire."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I am perfectly satisfied with your presence,"  observed Charles; "neither do I believe that Miss  Walworth feels it disagreeable. You must, indeed,  Mr. Morley, be much altered since I knew you, if  you have become an unpleasant companion."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"I have no objection to the gentleman's company,"  said Arabella; "but he himself seemed to  think that we did not want it. Did you not think  so, Mr. Morley? I must have you to speak candidly  on the question."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"I really did think then, my fair catechizer,"  said Morley, "that you might have something of  a confidential nature to discuss, which my presence  would interrupt: I therefore expressed the  idea, so that if it happened to be correct, I might  at once relieve you of the interruption; for I assure  you, my friends, much as I value your society,  I do not wish to enjoy it at the expense of  your satisfaction."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Well, let us drop the discussion," said the  lady; "and since Captain Adderly has no objection  to your company, and you seem to desire his,  I have no right to interfere between you. But,  perhaps, gentlemen, you would both feel more  comfortable in my absence."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Oh, Miss Walworth!" observed Charles, "how  can you think so? Surely you do not suppose that  my late residence among the Indians has made  me such a savage as that?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"No---far be it from me," she replied, "to  think so. But there are some young fellows who,  I believe, have never been five miles out of the  bounds of Penn's city, whose manners frequently  appear as if they had been altogether bred among  savages."</p>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"Miss Walworth," said Morley, who felt this  remark to be levelled at himself, "if my inconsiderate  expression has offended you, I recant it.---  But no---it was truth---I really perceive that my  presence has disagreeably interrupted the enjoyment  of more pleasing company."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Whether I prefer the company of others to  yours, or not," she replied, "has, surely, Mr. Morley,  nothing to do with my assertion as to the savages  I have seen bred in Philadelphia; for, I  assure you, I have seen some in this city so rude,  that, although their friends and their fortunes may  sometimes gain them admission into good company,  I would, for my part, rather see one of the  wild Chippeways stalking into my presence."</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"You are too severe upon the youth of your native  city," observed Charles, "who felt for Morley,  as he perceived him much mortified; "surely,  Miss Walworth you do not include us all in  your remarks?"</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"God forbid," she exclaimed; "the same Paradise  that contained an angel, we are told contained  also a serpent." "But what say you, Mr.  Morley," she continued, smiling in that gentleman's  face, in order to relieve his chagrin, which  she saw had been as highly excited as she wished;  "what say you, my friend, would it not be for the  advantage of some of our young people, ladies, I  believe, as well as gentlemen, to visit the savages  to get their city rust rubbed off? Pray, Captain  Adderly, what kind of women are <emph>those</emph> squaws?---  Have you ever seen any of them you thought  handsome? But, Mr. Morley, be pleased to be  seated, and then Captain Adderly will let us hear  of those Indian women."</p>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"Miss Walworth, I am all complaisance to the  commands of the fair," replied Morley, seating  himself beside Charles. "One smile from <pb n="131"/> beautiful lips will always remove from my mind the impression  of a thousand frowns."</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Ah! you are very good-natured, I know,"  she returned; "but, my dear sir, you look so well  in the pet, that it would be a pity you should not  sometimes fall into it; and then again you are so  much improved on your recovery, really it is delightful  to see you go through the process of a little  ill-humour.

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Thank you, sir," she observed; "hence at  once is seen the reason why the squaws are so  good-natured. I'll warrant you, if they had some  of our Philadelphia bucks among them, they would  soon change their tempers. But you didn't tell  me if they are handsome?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah! Miss Walworth," replied Charles, "you  must excuse me there. My eyes, I believe, have  too much Christian partiality in their vision, to be  a proper judge in this matter; and present beauty  I have ever felt blind-folding in its qualities."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"I understand you, sir," she returned smartly;  "although it is odd, too, that beauty should have  upon you an effect so different from what it has on  other people, who generally accuse it of too much  brightness. Yonder are some ladies opposite to <pb n="132"/> us, from whose countenances I will undertake to  say, that Mr. Morley will acknowledge he sees  light issuing; and let him converse but five minutes  with any one of them, he will protest that her eyes  dart flames. How then, sir, could they blind-fold  you?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Perhaps by excess of light," returned Charles. "Men, you know, have been struck blind by lightning.  But yonder is the signal for another set.---  Miss Walworth, have the goodness to honour  me---"</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he arose, bowed to the lady, who  gave him her hand, and whispering to Morley to  follow with a partner, he led his fair companion  smiling towards the dancing part of the company.</p>

<p>But joy on earth is never lasting. A few hours  rolled round, and the merry revellers of this gay  party were obliged to separate. They accordingly  hastened to their respective homes, where on  their dull couches, (such are the contrasts of human  life) they sought repose from the fatigue of  joy, and concealment from the admiring gaze of  the world.</p>

<p>A close intimacy was now cultivated between  the families of Adderly and Walworth; the heads  of which, with great satisfaction, conceived that  their plans for a still closer connexion, were on the  fair way of being soon accomplished. Not a week  passed but reciprocal parties were several times  given at both houses. Mrs. Adderly never seemed  so happy as when she had her son to accompany  her on visits to Arabella; and Arabella never  permitted any other engagements to interfere with  her returning these visits. Charles, on such occasions,  frequently found his presence expected to  accompany her both in coming and going; and  very often, so familiar did their intimacy during  the autumn become, he was put in requisition to <pb n="133"/>  attend her, in her carriage to short excursions into  the country. There they often recreated themselves  amidst groves, and shady bowers, and by  the banks of purling brooks, and all the tempting  situations for love; and Charles, it must not be denied,  frequently found his natural fondness for the  sex in such situations excited to a passing feeling  of something like tenderness for the fair companion  of his dangerous rambles. But he meritoriously  held fast to his heart's integrity. Meritoriously  did I say! Alas! he had no merit in the affair. It  was his feelings, feelings of affection and passion  interwoven with his very existence, that kept him  constant to his first and only love. What, if he  felt his heart warm at the soft seducing glances,  and love-speaking blushes of the universally admired  beauty of the gay world, who indulged him  with so much of her society! What, if he felt a  keener throb than usual beating at his heart, as  leaning on his arm she would, perhaps involuntarily,  press it to her bosom! There surely was  nothing of infidelity in it. There might be weakness  in it, but it was the weakness of human nature,  and but momentary. One single reflection  upon the charms of his distant Maria would calm  the storm, restore him to strength, and to those  feelings of true love that he delighted to cherish.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be concealed, that in some  of those unguarded moments, his natural politeness  was perhaps exceeded in the warmth of expression  with which he complimented his fair and  tempting companion. But these compliments, although  often taken for more than they really expressed,  by the young lady who wished them to  express more, were never intended by Charles to  express even half their literal meaning; and were  sometimes more than half repented of ere they  were fully uttered. It must also be said in his <pb n="134"/> justification, that had he conceived Miss Walworth  would have looked upon them in any other  light than as the mere dictates of that common-place  gallantry and politeness, due by all men to a  fine woman, he would have allowed no temptation  to induce him to utter them.</p>

<p>He was all this time not aware that he was looked  upon by the whole city as the favoured and fortunate  candidate for Miss Walworth's hand. His  pointed attentions to her, and the exclusive preference  she so publicly gave him over all her other  admirers, were of themselves sufficient to give rise  to this opinion, which was now become the current  report and firm belief of all the gossips of the  day; but it was also so strongly corroborated and  almost confirmed by the fact transpiring, whether  by accident or design is not material, of the lady's  guardian and the gentleman's father, having actually  agreed upon the conditions of the match,  that the most skeptical on the subject could not  at last withhold their assent to the truth of the  report.</p>

<p>Matters were thus circumstanced, when one  day Charles went to pay his usual visit to Mr.  Walworth's. The servant informed him, that  Miss Walworth was in the drawing-room. He  ascended the stairs without ceremony, and, the  door of the drawing-room being a little open, he  had scarcely reached the landing-place, when he  heard the young lady saying in a voice rather  above her usual tone to some person in the  room---</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"It is a matter, sir, that cannot concern you.  I have a right to bestow my affections, yes, and  my hand too, upon any person I choose---and if I  have preferred Captain Adderly, it has been my  own pleasure to do so, and I hope, sir, I am not <pb n="135"/> accountable to you for my preferences or my conduct."</p>
            </quote>   

<p>Charles paused for a moment, uncertain whether  to advance or retire; he would have done  the latter, but he had already advanced too far,  for the lady, who was walking about the room,  happened that instant to see him, and exclaimed---</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Ah, here is Charles himself coming!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>He hastened forward, while she held out her  hand, which he gracefully saluted, and turning  round, made a bow to his friend, Mr. Morley,  which was returned with a dry and rather offensive  nod.</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Captain Adderly," said the lady, assuming an  air of great irritation and triumph, "that gentleman  has just had the impertinence to question me  as to the disposal of my heart, and to complain of  the preference I have given you, as if I were not  my own mistress, and could not bestow my affections  upon whom I please. He has, indeed, teazed  me this some time past, with his ridiculous addresses,  in a manner that I am determined to tolerate  no longer."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I hope he has not insulted you?" asked  Charles.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"No, he has not exactly insulted me," she replied;  "his language is of too whining a nature for  that. But I wish to God he would, for the future,  refrain from annoying me with his importunities.  I will here repeat to him, that I shall give my  hand to whomsoever I choose---and I will add,  that his presence can be at present dispensed  with."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Morley"><p>"I shall, then, proud fair one, bid you good  morning," said Morley. "But I must first state  to Captain Adderly, that I have no quarrel with  him; and, heaven knows! it is still further from  my wishes to have any with you. My only fault <pb n="136"/> has been, in spite of myself, loving you too sincerely;  a fault which I shall, if possible, endeavour  for the future to correct. But if I should  not be able to do so, believe me, I shall not, at  any rate, disturb your peace with the man you  prefer."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he made each of them a polite bow  and withdrew.</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Oh, my Charles!" cried Miss Walworth,  throwing herself upon a chair, "you know not, although  I ought to have told you, how much I have  been lately teazed with that young fellow."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles scarcely knew what reply to make to  such an address. It unequivocally insinuated that  she regarded him as her favourite lover, an idea  which she had never before conveyed in such express  terms. Her conduct had, indeed, often manifested  that she entertained such an idea. But  he had ventured to hope, especially as he was  conscious of having never made any direct declaration  of love to her, that he must have been mistaken  in his construction of her conduct. Her conduct  and language were now, however, both too  plain for mistake, and he felt embarrassed, not  knowing whether he should undeceive her at  once with respect to his feelings, or let her discover  them more gradually by his future deportment  towards her. Both were harsh, and, after  the intimacy he had himself so imprudently cultivated  with her, perhaps ungenerous measures, and  grating to his feelings---but the last was certainly  the least so, and he determined to adopt it.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Miss Walworth," said he, "what the nature  of your intercourse with Mr. Morley has been,  you know it is no more my right to inquire than  it was his to interrogate you about your intimacy  with me. I would be equally culpable with him <pb n="137"/>  if I were to do so; and you would be equally entitled  to resent my conduct."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"How, Charles!" she cried, "can I understand  you? Do you not speak mysteriously? Is  it not in my power to prefer you to him, and have  I not done so? Has my conduct not all along  shown it? Have you not, therefore, privileges on  which he had no right to presume?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I acknowledge," said Charles, "that you  have a right to regulate, according to your own  pleasure, the privileges you allow your friends,  and I cannot but feel grateful at the superior confidence  you seem willing to repose in me, and I  can at least make this return for it, that I will not  betray it."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"What means this?" she muttered with a tone  of surprise and some irritation, "this cold chilling  return! the privilege I allow <emph>my friends!</emph> Is it  Captain Adderly that speaks so!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>Here she became much agitated, and for a few  moments continued silent. At length relapsing  into tenderness, and bursting into tears, she cried, "Oh, Charles! surely I have not deserved this  from you. You, from whose attentions I have  derived so much pleasure---you, to whom I have  given up my heart---to whom I have now exposed  all my weakness. Alas! have I been deceived  by your professions! If so, I am indeed miserable!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Be calm, Miss Walworth," returned Charles, greatly moved, and willing to soothe her---for at  that moment he had not the heart to increase the  pangs he had already inflicted--- "Alas! be composed,  my dear madam; whatever professions I  have made, they may have been mistaken, but I  assure you that they never were intended to be so."  Here the propriety of resolving not to encourage  her delusion recurred to him, and he added, "For <pb n="138"/> the future my conduct shall lead to no mistake.  Miss Walworth, I shall leave you now to become  tranquillized, and believe me, it shall afford me  great pleasure to hear that you have succeeded."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he bade her good morning, and was  retiring when she caught him by the arm, and exclaimed---</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Oh, Charles! Charles! do not leave me thus,  without some assurance that you love me; for,  alas! you have raised a doubt."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"How different is this woman from the mild,  the modest, the retiring Maria!" thought he, and  he was at once determined how to act.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Excuse me, Miss Walworth," he replied;  "from my soul I pity you, but I can assure you of  nothing more at present."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Then---then---" she cried, "what means that covenant concerning us, into which your father and  my uncle have entered?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"What covenant?" asked Charles, with surprise.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Is it possible that you know not of it?" said she.</p>
            </quote> 

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I assure you, upon my honour, I know nothing  of it," he replied.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Ah! then, I am doubly deceived," said she.  "My uncle spoke of it as a marriage treaty, and  I presumed, alas! what errors have I not presumed,  that it was your doing."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Miss Walworth, by heavens! I believe you  have indeed been deceived!" he cried, with considerable  fervour. "The innocent, the unmeaning  pleasure I took in your company may have led  to all these mistakes; but I shall now endeavour  to correct them. May heaven forgive me, I really  believe I have sinned against you. But I will  stay no longer, lest I repeat my fault." So saying,  he hurried from her presence.</p>
            </quote>

    <pb n="139"/>

<p>The next morning, Charles, availing himself of  a pressing invitation he had received from a friend  who lived near Bristol, about twenty miles up the  Delaware, set out on horseback for that place.  There he remained for about a week, and had  time leisurely to weigh his past conduct. He  could not recollect any thing for which he could  seriously condemn himself. He had, indeed, frequently  complimented Miss Walworth in terms of  high eulogy on both her personal charms and elegant  manners; but then she really deserved his  encomiums, and he had no conception that she would  place any more value upon them than what they  were merely worth, namely, the light, airy, and often  unmeaning and unreflecting expressions of a gay  and thoughtless mind telling a beautiful young  woman how pleased he was with her society, but  neither telling, nor intending to tell more.</p>

<p>This was the sum of his offending; and if it was  venial in itself, surely he was not answerable for  any misconstruction that either she or the world  might put upon it. He was sorry, indeed, on her  account, that such a misconstruction had taken  place, but the only thing he could now, do to repair  the unintentional injury he had done her,  was by avoiding her society, to undeceive all parties,  as to his views in having courted it. With  respect to his fidelity to Maria, he had nothing  for which either to accuse or applaud himself.  He felt the constancy of his unspeakable love for  her unshaken; but for this he claimed no praise,  as he knew that it was a constancy which could  only fail when the life-blood ceased to animate  his heart.</p>

<p>He returned to the city on the seventh day, after  leaving it, in obedience to a summons from his  father. A few hours after arriving in town, feeling  a disposition for meditation and study, he <pb n="140"/> retired to his apartment without having seen his father,  whom necessary business had kept out during the  whole evening. Before he was long there, however,  his father entered, with a countenance more  solemn and stern than he had ever recollected  to see him assume. He placed a light he had  brought in his hand, deliberately and silently  upon the table, and seating himself upon a chair,  drew out his pocket-book, from which he took  a paper, and also laid it on the table. After  returning the pocket-book to its place, and adjusting  himself a little more commodiously on the  chair, he at length spoke, but it was not to give  his son a kindly welcome from the country---  it was to reprimand him for going there.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Sir," said he, it "appears that you took your  flight at the very time you should have attended  to make your explanationst o a beautiful young  lady, whom, by your pretensions and professions,  you have betrayed into the belief that you loved  her, and thereby succeeded in making an impression  on her heart. Your departure under  such circumstances, is looked upon, and I am sorry  to say, with an air of great probability, as an  intended desertion of this young woman: and the  whole city is now crying out shame against you  for such perfidious conduct. Have you aught, sir,  to say in extenuation of your fault?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"My father," replied Charles; "it grieves me  to hear you address me in such language, and it  grieves me still more to think that you have been  capable of suspecting, may, of accusing me of perfidy  to any person. But I have this consolation,  amidst the misfortune of your displeasure, to be  conscious that the charge on which it is founded,  is unjust; and the only thing I can say in extenuation  of the fault you mention, is, that it never was  intentionally or knowingly committed."</p>
            </quote>

   <pb n="141"/>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"What say you?" asked his father with surprise:  "Did you never make love to Miss Walworth?  answer me, honestly, as you value my  favour or my displeasure."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I will answer you honestly then, my father,"  said Charles, "I never did."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"You never did! What then meant all your attentions  to her, your perpetual running after her  company, gallanting with her, flattering her, and  complimenting her beauty and numerous excellent  qualities, of which it is well ascertained, that  you were not sparing?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Father," replied Charles, "pardon me if I say  that you are too well acquainted with the manners  of the world, not to know the true value and  import of such compliments, as in the thoughtless  hours of amusement and gaiety, our sex has been  long in the habit of paying to the other, and which  the other has long been in the habit of receiving  as unmeaningly as they are given. Beyond such  common-place compliments, I assure you I have  never gone in my intercourse with Miss Walworth;  and allow me to justify myself by saying,  that in paying her these compliments, I conceived  that I had done nothing but what, from the customs  of society, her youth and accomplishments  entitled her to expect from any man who had any  pretensions to good-breeding."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"So, after all it appears," returned his father,  "that the amount of your attentions towards her,  was mere good-breeding."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"So I consider it," replied Charles.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"But it seems that both the young lady, and the  whole city, consider it otherwise," said his father.</p>
            </quote> 

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Both the lady and the city must be mistaken,  then," observed Charles, "although in consideration  of the lady's feelings, I will say so to none <pb n="142"/> but you, to whom, alone, I am anxious to justify  myself."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Certainly you know the meaning of your own  conduct best," observed the father. "But, pray,  how did it happen that you paid such unusual attention  to one to whom you now profess your  heart to have been indifferent?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah, sir," said Charles, "may I remind you, that  the intercourse which called for these attentions,  was not, at first, of my seeking; and through its  whole continuance, it is with extreme reluctance,  I say, though it be only to the ear of a father from  whom I wish to conceal nothing, that I was more  sought after, or else fortuitously thrown into her  company, than would many a time have been my  choice."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"This statement may be correct," observed his  father in a somewhat more kindly tone, "and I am  sorry for it, although it pleases me to find that  you have yet done nothing to deserve the censure  which is gone abroad against you. But, Charles,  I had set my heart upon your marrying this young  woman. I wish anxiously to see you established  in life; and in the whole city, I do not know a  match that would be more advantageous to you,  nor could I imagine that any could be found more  attractive. Her uncle is also desirous to form the  connexion, and we had gone so far, on the presumption  that no objection could arise on your  part, as to arrange the conditions of the marriage  articles. The reason of my not communicating  this to you, was, that I expected every day  to receive an application from you on the subject,  which would have been the most natural  course of proceeding, and by far the most agreeable  to all parties. I am sorry that the proposal  must originate, at last, with me; for as matters exist  now, I perceive that there is no other expedient <pb n="143"/> left. Your consent is alone wanted, to effect a  union which must give great and permanent satisfaction  to all concerned, and on which the whole  community had lately set their eyes and expectations.  What say you, my son, will you consent to  marry the richest and most beautiful young lady  in the city, whose love for you is now so unequivocally  declared, that ever since the day of your  supposed desertion, she has not appeared in company,  nor, as that letter on the table states, left  her bedchamber. But you may peruse it, sir, it  is from her uncle, and I hope it will make some  impression upon your mind."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Robert Walworth"><p>"Dear Sir---The progress we have made in the  transaction, in which your son and my niece were  to be the parties disposed of, had induced me to  hope for a speedy and final settlement of the affair;  but I am sorry to say, that owing to some  misadventure on the part of your son, the bargain  is likely to fail on your side. My niece,  which was the part of the concern for which I  stood engaged, is still substantial and ready for delivery,  when the equivalent shall be forthcoming,  and the demand made."</p>

<p>"Your son, it appears, after having, by much  management, embezzled the esteem or love, or  heart, or whatever you women's-men choose to  call it, of my niece, has become a defaulter and  decamped from the premises, leaving her in a  very destitute and forlorn state. She will not  leave her own chamber; and as she scarcely makes  use of an infant's allowance of nourishment, I  fear that her health will give way, if it has not already  done so, under the pressure of this unexpected  shock."</p>

    <pb n="144"/>

<p>"As the head and principal manager of the firm  from whose deficiency in the stock of proper conduct,  our present embarrassments have arisen, I  call upon you, as you value the honour and standing  of your establishment, as well as the credit  and prosperity of ours, to make all exertions to  procure the needful, and by promptly acquitting  yourselves of your obligations, relieve us out of  our present distresses."</p>

<p>"Your due attention to these matters, is earnestly  requested at as early a day as you can command."</p>   

<p>"I am, with proper consideration, your most obedient  servant,"</p>

            </quote>

       
<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I am, indeed, sorry that Miss Walworth has  taken this matter so much to heart," said Charles,  replacing the very classical epistle he had been  reading upon the table. "But I cannot see why so  much blame should be attached to either you or  me in the affair. For my part, I stand pledged to  her for the performance of no engagement whatever;  and, my dear father, pardon me, when I  make use of an expression, which I apply solely  to this banker's interference, I have no notion  whatever of being in this manner bullied into a  marriage."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Charles," observed his father, more mildly  than he expected. "This letter is addressed to  me. Its style may not be exactly what a pupil of  Trinity College would consider suited to the subject,  but it conveys explicitly enough the meaning  of the honest man who wrote it; and is designed  only to call upon me, who have pledged myself to  forward the intended connexion with all my influence,  to exert that influence in procuring your  consent to it. Now, Charles, what I have to say  on the subject is this: I know that love can never <pb n="145"/>  be produced by an exertion of authority, or by the  use of threats, and since you have satisfied me that  you have not, as is reported, acted meanly towards  Miss Walworth, I am not now disposed to use  either. But I would recommend you to think seriously,  and as a man of feeling, upon the situation  of the lady who has evidently become attached to  you; and I know so much of the tender passions,  that I have more reliance upon your becoming impressed  favourably towards her on account of what  she feels for you, than from the fear of any threats or  displeasure I might exercise to enforce your compliance.  I wish you, therefore, my son, not to drop  the intercourse you have lately held with her.---  Visit her as before, that you may put a stop to the  malicious exultation of those who now feel a triumph  in her supposed desertion, and if possible,  incline your feelings to think tenderly of her."</p>
            </quote>
 
<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I shall visit her, my father," replied Charles,  "in obedience to your commands; but I trust that  your good sense will not, in the mean time, require  any further promise from me."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles accordingly did visit her. He found  her melancholy, discontented, and irritable; evidently  suffering under the tortures of wounded  pride, as well as of disappointed love.</p>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"Captain Adderly," said she, "you have given  that coxcomb Morley a triumph over me, which it  was ungenerous in you to allow. But that is of no  consequence; this triumph I can well bear, nay,  I can bear without much agony the scandal of tea-tables,  and the contempt of the world, that you  have procured me, but I cannot bear your disdain  without sinking under it. It is now too late to  say that I do not love you, but I will entreat nothing  from you. It is kind in you to visit me.---  It may rescue me from the contempt of my enemies;  and on your part, it shows compassion, <pb n="146"/> but, alas! what is compassion from you without  love?"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles occasionally visited this young lady during  the winter; but he took care not to take the  same liberties with her as formerly. She for a  time continued rather to decline in health, as his  visits, cold and formal as they were, inspired her  with just sufficient hopes to add the pangs of suspense  to those of disappointment. At length  Charles supposed that, if all uncertainty in respect  to him were removed from her mind, her reason  might assist her pride to overcome her tenderness,  and produce her recovery.</p>

<p>He accordingly, one day that he felt very much  affected with her condition, addressed her in a  more confidential tone than usual.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Miss Walworth," said he, "I have for some  time past, been impressed with the idea that you  really believe I feel some aversion towards you.  But I assure you, I have no such feeling. I am  not blind to your various excellences. I see them,  and I esteem and admire them---nay, there is only  one of your sex in the world who possesses more  of my admiration. Ah! if it were not for her dear  image pre occupying all my heart, it might, in all  probability, have been long ago yours, for next to  her, I am persuaded you are the only woman  whom I ever saw, that I might have been brought  to love. But after having seen her, it is impossible  I can ever love another. Thus, Miss Walworth,  you see the esteem I have for you, by the  confidence I now repose in you; and you also see  the utter impossibility of my having returned you  that tenderness and affection with which you have  been pleased to honour me. But, believe me, I  never for a moment felt disposed to triumph over  you on account of your showing me your attachment.  Such feelings, I know to be beyond our <pb n="147"/> own control; and because you must be convinced  that they are so, I hope you will be the more  ready to pardon my seeming indifference for those  attractions which the whole world acknowledges,  and to which I never was blind."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Arabella Walworth"><p>"I feel, alas!" said she, "that these feelings  are indeed beyond our control. I thank, sincerely  thank you, for this confidence. I see now  the barrier that separated us, and perceive that it  can never be overcome.

<p>Miss Walworth did speedily recover after this  period; and I may here mention, for my reader's  satisfaction, that the constancy of the enamoured  Morley, who, instead of triumphing, as she supposed  he would, at her disappointment, had really  sympathized in her affliction, and had stood her  advocate amidst all the slander that was heaped  upon her, made such an impression on her mind,  that she rewarded him with her hand about a year  after the recovery of her health and tranquillity. I  may also add, that her affliction having had the  salutary effect of curing her of a great portion of  her pride, she became an excellent wife, a tender  mother, and an amiable member of society.</p>

<l>Sooner shall the eagle of heaven be torn from the stream of his roaring  wind, when he sees the dun prey before him, the young sons of the bounding  roe, than thou, O Cathmor, be turned from the strife of renown.</l>
<l><emph>Ossian.</emph></l>
</lg>

<p>The pleasing sensations experienced during the  spring months, when nature resumes all the fascinating  softness and beauty of her original youth,  it has been long and often observed, have a wonderful  effect in disposing the minds of all, especially  of lovers, to unusual tenderness and fervour.  Affections that seemed before to be as  strong, faithful, fond, and endearing, as the human  heart is capable of feeling, appear now to become  at least more restlessly and actively so; and separation  from a beloved object, which the force of  reason might, at other times, have enabled us to  endure, in this seductive season becomes often  intolerable.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, owing to this mysterious influence  of the sweet season, that Charles Adderly,  although it ertainly could not be said that his affection  for Maria had sustained or was capable of  sustaining any increase, in the spring of 1755, felt  unusual anxiety to behold her. To inform his father  of his wishes, with a view to obtain his permission  to return to the western woods, he knew  would be fruitless; and might be injudicious, by  affording a motive, in case of any favourable opportunity  offering to facilitate his return, of forbidding  him to embrace it.</p>

    <pb n="149"/>

<p>Charles secretly contemplated the occurrence  of such an opportunity, in the march of a British  army to act against Fort Du Quesne, the landing  of which on the shores of America was every day  expected. Nor was it long until he heard the joyful  intelligence of a respectable armament of  European soldiers under General Braddock having  reached the shores of Virginia, with the avowed  intention of proceeding against the French.---  He immediately solicited, and not, it is true, without  some difficulty, obtained his father's consent to  join this army as a volunteer. Elated with the  prospect of soon again seeing his beloved, and assisting  to expel the enemy from her neighbourhood,  he hastened to Alexandria, where Braddock  had agreed to meet a convention of the different  governors of the colonies, in order to settle the  plan of the campaign.</p>

<p>Here Charles met with his former commander,  Colonel Washington, whom Braddock, anxious to  employ in the intended service, had appointed one  of his aids-de-camp. This gentleman's friendship  and influence soon procured for him the appointment  of captain of one of the Virginia ranging  companies, that were to be attached to the army,  and Charles being thus fixed to his satisfaction,  impatiently awaited the day when the troops should  be ordered to march.</p>

<p>After various, and to Charles, extremely vexatious  delays, occasioned by the difficulty of obtaining  sufficient supplies of provisions, waggons, and  other articles necessary for the expedition, the  army, at length was put in motion, and proceeded  to a fort at Will's Creek, afterwards called Fort  Cumberland, which was the most western post  then held by the English on the continent. From  this place there was no road on which the waggons  could pass, and it began to be feared that the <pb n="150"/> delay which would be necessary to cut one through  such an exceedingly woody and rough country,  would allow the enemy time to collect such a force  as might endanger the success of the enterprise.  The army, however, courageously struggled with  all obstacles, until it had advanced as far as the  Great Meadows, where the difficulties of the way  were found to increase so much, that General  Braddock, who had at first rejected the advice of  Washington to carry only such baggage as could  be taken forward on horses, and to leave his long  dilatory train of waggons behind, was now compelled  to adopt it so far as to bring onwards only  the light waggons and tumbrels.</p>

<p>Still anxiously aware of the necessity of expedition  towards securing the success of the enterprise,  Washington also advised the general to press  forward, with all haste, with a chosen body of  troops, and only such stores, artillery, and ammunition,  as were of immediate and prime necessity.  His reasons for this advice were, that their accounts  informed them that the French were now  weak on the Ohio, but were in momentary expectation  of reinforcements; that during the present  drought, these reinforcements could not pass down  the Alleghany river, but, that if the march were  protracted by waiting to bring forward the whole  army and baggage, sufficient rains to raise the waters  might come on, by which means the garrison  at Du Quesne might receive their expected succours  before it should be attacked, and might in  consequence be able to set all the force of the expedition  at defiance.</p>

<p>These considerations agreed well with the fiery  temper of General Braddock. Twelve hundred  of his best troops were accordingly selected, at  the head of whom he proceeded with what baggage  and military stores could be carried on <pb n="151"/> horses and in a few light vehicles, as rapidly as possible  to the place of destination. With the residue  of the army, Colonel Dunbar was left at the  Great Meadows, with instructions to follow with  them and the heavy baggage in the rear, by slow  and easy marches.</p>

<p>It was about the latter part of June when this  select corps moved from the Great Meadows.---  It proceeded on with as much celerity as the numerous  impediments of the country would permit;  but, although divested of every unnecessary incumbrance,  and although the soldiers were encouraged  to high alacrity and zeal by the almost  certain anticipation of soon lodging themselves in  Fort Du Quesne---for neither General Braddock  nor his regular troops, could suppose that there  was any enemy then in the country able to resist  them---yet it was not until the eighth of July that  they came within sight of the ford below Turtle  Creek, where they were to cross the Monongehala.  Here they stopped a few hours to refresh  themselves before they should attempt the ford,  expecting the next day to be in possession of Fort  Du Quesne.</p>

<p>How did Charles's heart beat, when casting his  delighted view over the expanse of this noble river,  he beheld the smoke curling from the dwelling  of his Maria, and thought that in a few hours  he might fold her to his bosom. There was also  another individual in the army of still higher rank  and eminence than Charles, whose heart equally  throbbed when he beheld the spot which contained  this sweet flower of the Wilderness; this was  the noble-souled Washington, who loved Maria  with a passion never exceeded in faith, fervour,  intensity, and disinterestedness, by any that ever  man felt for woman. But although the heart of  this truly devoted lover, as from a distance he <pb n="152"/> contemplated the abode of her who reigned within  it, felt a throb as warm, and keen, and rapturous as  any that could be felt by Charles, yet that throb,  though equally rapturous, was not equally unmingled  with sorrow, for he, alas, anticipated no affectionate  embrace, no tender glance indicative of  mutual love, and reciprocal gratitude to heaven  for the joyful meeting. The delight of again beholding  and conversing with her, and perhaps, a  hope that he might not converse in vain, (for what  lover feels not such hope) however, actuated  and inspired his mind, and he also trusted that now  was come the time when she should be no longer  endangered by the vicinity of a lawless and savage  foe.</p>

<p>But this young hero felt a sadness intermix itself  with these feelings of delight, which sadness  arose not altogether from his consciousness of not  possessing Maria's love. It was greatly occasioned  by some circumstances attending the march of  the army that was to expel the foe from her vicinity;  for he knew the wily nature of the foe, and  he grieved much to see the rashness of the general  by whom that gallant army was led on to the  encounter.</p>

<p>When at Will's Creek, he had taken the liberty  to caution the general on this subject. In place  of marching carelessly along, in one body, through  a thick forest, every where intersected with dells  and dingles, and ravines, affording lurking places  for an ambushed enemy, he earnestly recommended  that scouts and rangers should be sent forward  on the course of their march, to scour the country,  by which means any ambuscade that might be  formed for them would be discovered, and perhaps  rooted out, before the army came upon it  unawares.</p>

    <pb n="153"/>

<p>Braddock who, although a brave man, seems to  have been very deficient in that prompt sagacity  which is necessary to form a good general, despised  this advice; nay, it is said, that he had the littleness  of mind to reply to it in terms of contempt  for the youth and inexperience of him who  gave it.</p>

<p>Washington, whom love, patriotism, humanity,  and every generous motive that can actuate the  mind of man, rendered zealous for the success of  the enterprise, easily forgave these contemptuous  expressions; but when he reflected on the dreadful  consequences of a defeat, not to the army  alone, but also to the country, and to her whom  he loved above all earthly things, his heart all resolute,  courageous, and fearless as it was, sunk  within him, and he could not help feeling a presentiment  of some fatal result, against which their  leader seemed too careless or too haughty to provide.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas!" thought he, as a few days before the  army left the Great Meadows, he contemplated the  appearance of the gallant and well-disciplined  soldiers of Britain, as they moved before him  through their various evolutions on parade; "into  what destruction may not the imprudence of your  commander plunge you! Ah, what will avail your  unrivalled discipline, and your invincible courage,  if his headstrong rashness acts as your evil genius,  and drives you foolishly, barbarously, and uselessly  into some abyss of ruin, where neither courage  nor discipline can serve you! And you, my country,  of what dreadful consequence would such an  event be to you. Your peaceful citizens would  then, indeed, feel tenfold the horrors that they  have ever yet felt, from the bloody tomahawk,  and the scalping-knife of the rapacious and savage  foe. And thou, O thou beloved of my heart! <pb n="154"/> thou fairest, purest, dearest object of this visible  creation! ah, it may be that thou wilt be the  first to suffer! alas, it may be that thou hast already  suffered for the friendship of thy family towards  me. Or, oh God, it may be that some  lawless, licentious Frenchman may have been  excited to horrible lust for the possession of thy  incomparable charms, and may have made thee  the helpless, perhaps the mangled victim of some  diabolical deed! Oh God! Oh God! support me  under the agony of such an idea!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>The blood quickened in his veins at the horrid  thought; and the force of these disagreeable  contemplations, taken altogether, produced upon  his frame, manly and vigorous as it was, such an  effect that he fell into a raging fever. While he  was labouring under this malady, the troops marched,  and the commander-in-chief, who, notwithstanding  he contemned his advice as to the management  of the expedition, esteemed him highly,  left strict injunctions upon him not on any account  to follow them until he should be recovered.</p>

<p>The second day after their departure, however,  although his fever still continued, and the  physician declared that his adhering to the army  would endanger his life, his anxiety of mind concerning  the fate of the expedition, which was now  hastening towards the residence of his beloved,  was such, that no consideration could prevent him  from following it, which he did in a covered waggon.  Both duty and love impelled him to this step.  For he had within him a feeling which told him  that it might be in his power, if not to prevent the  general from adopting rash measures, at least to  lessen their disastrous consequences. This violent  effort restored energy to his mind, and he  overtook the army the day before it reached the <pb n="155"/> ford at Turtle Creek. From the south bank of the  Monongahela, on which the troops had descended  for the last four or five days, having before crossed  the river above the Youhiegany, as he beheld  the undisturbed appearance of Frazier's dwelling,  his hopes whispered that all was yet safe with its  inmates, and he became greatly tranquilized, and  resumed the performance of his duty on horseback.</p>   

<p>While stationed here, and until the van had  about half crossed the ford, not an individual in  the army dreamed of meeting with any opposition  until they should reach Du Quesne; for as  to Washington's feelings on the subject, they arose  from a sagacious calculation of the advantages  which the imprudence of Braddock would allow to the crafty foes he was to encounter, if they  should lie in ambush for him, rather than from  any prophetic certainty that there would be an  ambush laid. Nay, he at this moment, began to  entertain strong hopes that the enemy might, on  this occasion, contrary to their usual practice,  neglect to profit by the advantage which was thus  afforded them.</p>

<p>These hopes, however, were but short lived.  His anticipations of the worst were but too soon  fatally realized, and this joyous and high-minded  army experienced, at this place, a disaster which  sent half their number, and their rash general  along with them, to eternity; and from which, it  required all the wisdom, energy, and heroism of  Washington, to rescue the remainder.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to detail the circumstances  of the celebrated and calamitous battle  which occasioned this disaster, I beg permission,  in order to give the reader a clearer view of it, to  describe the ground on which it was fought.</p>

    <pb n="156"/>

<p>The stream of the Monongahela, at this place,  runs nearly from east to west, while that of Turtle  Creek, issuing out of a narrow and deep glen,  enters it from the northward. This glen widens  in its approach to the river, in consequence of its  western ridge diverging from the creek, and gradually  swelling backwards from it, from a quarter to half a mile. It continues this bearing of its  summit, at a similar distance from the Monongahela,  for about half a mile down it, throwing off,  as it descends towards it, three or four well-marked,  but gently declining tables of fertile land, the  lowermost of which forms a level bottom of  considerable breadth, extending along the river  where the ford is situated. About three quarters  of a mile below Turtle Creek this bottom ends,  the banks here becoming high and precipitous,  which is their general character on the north side,  and for a considerable way also on the south, until  they reach Pittsburgh, where Fort Du Quesne,  at the time of the transactions here narrated, the  reader need scarcely be reminded, was situated.</p>

<p>It was on the first of these tables, or flats of  land which arises from that adjoining the river,  that the principal destruction of Braddock's troops  took place, and the spot is, at least half a mile below  the mouth of Turtle Creck. Its breast, or  front towards the river, is a steep acclivity, elevated  from twenty to thirty feet above the adjacent  flat, and embraced between two gullies running  nearly parallel to each other, about three hundred  yards apart, and forming a square portion of  ground of eight or ten acres, gradually ascending  backwards for eight or nine hundred yards, to  where another table elevates its front above the  battle-ground, somewhat behind which, the high  summit of the sky-covered ridge overtops all.</p>

    <pb n="157"/>

<p>It was in these gullies that the Indians laid their fatal  ambush, amidst trees, long grass, thickly growing  shrubs, and various other kinds of close concealing  undergrowth, which completely screened  them from the view of their victims. The ground  itself was covered with long grass, interspersed  with many trees, but containing very little underwood.  The vegetation on the subjacent bottom  was much of the same description, being  perhaps a little more thick set with brush and  undergrowth.</p>

<p>Standing at the present day on this ground,  which is now called "Braddock's Field," a most  pleasing landscape, not very extensive it is true,  but certainly very romantic, variegated, and comfortable  in its aspect, strikes the view. To  the north, the ridge already mentioned, rises  above you---to the west, the view down the river  is limited by the high banks also already mentioned.  Directly south, the broad expanse of the  Monongahela, about a half a mile over, lies glittering  before you, while from its further bank,  the bank on which Braddock's army halted before  attempting the ford, the land rises gradually  and fertilely, without leaving an extensive margin,  as it does on the north side.</p>

<p>To the eastward the eye can ascend the river  for about a mile and a half above Turtle Creek,  for which distance, as the banks gradually withdraw  from the river on each side, they impart to  the fancy of the spectator a scene resembling  some of the more comfortable descriptions of a  highland glen, given by some of the late romantic  writers of Scotland.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most picturesque feature in the  whole landscape, is the winding stream of Turtle  Creek, above whose junction with the Monongahela,  the highland-looking glen just mentioned, <pb n="158"/> properly begins. This stream issues, as has been  said, from a glen northward of the river. When it first flows out of the gap of the glen, its course  is about south-west; but, when within a quarter of a mile of the river, it changes its direction to  the south-east, forming by that means a kind of  peninsula or point of land, lying between it and  the river, in the shape of a triangle, which triangle  consists altogether of a level river bottom of  rich land of three or four hundred acres, and is  the identical spot where our friend Gilbert Frazier  had made his residence.</p>

<p>The wild and sylvan appearance of this interesting  valley in "Braddock's Times," is now  changed by the hand of industry to one more rural  and more gratifying to the eye of the philanthropist.  In those times one solitary dwelling,  that of Frazier, was alone to be seen. Now, on  both sides of the river, as far as the view can  extend, numerous pleasant residences, some of  which are even elegant, surrounded with flourishing  plantations, decorate the scene, and suggest  pleasing reflections to every heart that wishes  well to humanity.</p>

</lg>

<p>The situation of the French garrison at Fort Du  Quesne during the spring and early part of the  summer of 1755, was rather perplexing and precarious.  Monsieur De Villiers who had succeeded  St. Pierre as its governor, had at this time only  about four hundred French soldiers under his  command, the remainder of those that had fought  at the Great Meadows having been detached to  other forts. He had taken great pains, if is true,  to conciliate the Indians, and had in reality succeeded  in acquiring over the different tribes a  vast influence. Still they were too little under  his control, and were too restless and roving in  their habits to form that species of force, which,  in the event of that attack which he had every  reason soon to expect from the British, he wished  to possess. He had, therefore, repeatedly written  to the Canadian government for succours; and as  soon as the season permitted, that government had  made exertions to send forward to him both a reinforcement  of men, and a supply of provisions and  military stores.</p>

    <pb n="160"/>

<p>These, however, had not got down from La  Boeuf before the falling of the waters; and De  Villiers could not now expect them before the  waters should again arise. A few days rain, he  knew, would produce that effect, and for this he  had in vain, with great anxiety, waited for several  weeks.</p>

<p>Matters were in this state at the garrison, when  about the beginning of July some Indians informed  him of the approach of Braddock. He immediately  sent out three or four trusty scouts to  watch the motions of the British, and soon received  intelligence that they had crossed to the south side  of the Monongahela. He then perceived that their  intention was to advance by the way of Turtle  Creek, there being no other fording place between  that and Du Quesne.</p>

<p>To dispute this passage with them was his first  intention; but resolving to view the ground before  he concluded on his measures, he for the first  time, paid a visit to Frazier's, where he unhappily  beheld, with surprise and admiration, the charms  of Maria. A violent passion for that unfortunate  young woman immediately seized upon his soul.  The hurried and alarming nature of the crisis,  however, imperiously demanding all his attention,  prevented him from at that time declaring it; but  he resolved to do so as soon as the approaching  contest should be decided. De Villiers was a widower  of about thirty years of age, of a temper  bold, sanguine, and irritable; and a man who permitted  no scruples of religion or morality to stand  in the way of his gratifications.</p>

<p>On viewing the ford, he perceived at once that  he had not a force sufficient to contest its passage to  any good purpose, with the army that he understood  was coming against him. He therefore resolved  to adopt another plan, in which the Indians could <pb n="161"/>  render him efficient service, as being more suited  to their mode of warfare. This was to form an  ambuscade, into which the British might be ensnared  to their destruction. He accordingly selected  the ground we have before described for  that purpose; and, as in case of its failure, he did  not wish his garrison to be much weakened, he  resolved chiefly to employ Indians in the affair.</p>

<p>He returned to the fort, and having assembled  about four hundred Indians, who were all excellent  marksmen, he informed them of his design,  and received their ready assent to put it into execution.  To each of these Indians he gave two  loaded rifles and eighteen charges of powder and  ball. With these rifles over their shoulders, and  their tomahawks and scalping-knives slung by  their sides, these warriors proceeded on the evening  of the 8th of July from the fort, to the place  of ambush, in order to lay it during the night, as  the British were expected to cross the ford the  next day. De Villiers, at the head of a hundred  of his best French soldiers accompanied them.---  Before the Indians departed they assembled outside  of the fort and loudly chanted the following</p>

<p>De Villiers arrived at the destined spot long  before daybreak. He gave the Indians the necessary  instructions how to act, and having placed  two hundred of them in each of the gullies before  noticed, he waited with his French troops at some  distance, also concealed, for the approach of the  enemy.</p>

<p>It was about noon when the British, having taken  some refreshment upon the south bank of the  river, general Braddock gave orders for passing  over. His van, composed of some light companies,  and a company of grenadiers, to the number  of three hundred men, when about half way over,  were unexpectedly fired upon by a small party of  French, who shewed themselves among the trees  near the bank. On firing, this party immediately <pb n="163"/> retired back from the river, and Braddock ordered  his van to hasten after them. On perceiving  this affair, Colonel Washington rode up to the  commander in chief, and begged him not to follow  the French, as evidently such a small number  of troops, acting as they did, by just shewing  themselves and retiring, were only intended as a  decoy into some ambuscade.</p>

<quote rend="General Braddock"><p>"My orders are to pursue these fellows," returned  Braddock; "and colonel Washington, I  have not been so long a soldier, I hope, without  knowing how to lead an army over a ford not  more than knee deep, in the face of a stronger  opposition than a few Frenchmen, without asking  advice from any man. I shall ask your opinion  when I think I need it."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Washington made no reply. He only sighed  as he perceived Colonel Gage, who commanded  the van, leading it on, after he had gained the  shore in pursuit of a few Frenchmen, who even  if they were either destroyed or captured, could  afford no laurels to the victors.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas!" said he, riding forward to Captain  Adderly, who was leading on his company of  Virginia rangers.--- "This is indeed madness---I  am afraid we shall pay dear for it. We must do  our duty, however."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I shall obey your directions alone, Colonel,"  replied Adderly, "to-day, as I know they will not  be inconsistent with my duty." ---So said all the  Virginian Captains. At that instant, Braddock,  at the head of the main body, had gained the  beach, and the order was given for the whole to  follow in the track that had been taken by the  van. Washington gave a signal for the Provincials  to advance; for he determined not to forsake  the regulars, although he so greatly disapproved  of their proceedings in thus inconsiderately <pb n="164"/> plunging into a thick grassy wood, with which  they were totally unacquainted, in pursuit of a  few fugitive Frenchmen.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Keeping an anxious eye upon the motions of  the soldiers in the van, he soon observed them  following the French up the front of the table-ground  between the gullies already described.  Only a few scattering shots had been as yet fired  by the French, as they retreated, which were  evidently intended to allure the British after them,  between the gullies where the Indians lay hidden,  and silently watching for their prey. In  this they succeeded to their utmost wish. The  van ascended the front of this piece of ground  with alacrity, and proceeded forward upon it for  about thirty or forty paces, suspecting and fearing  nothing, when, all at once the dreadful warwhoop  was heard; two hundred rifles from the  ground on their left, poured their destructive contents  upon them, and, the next instant, two hundred  from the right imitated the terrible example.  Two thirds of the van were now prostrated to the  earth. The firing for some minutes ceased, as  the Indians had now comparatively few objects  against whom to direct it. Braddock conceiving  the danger to be over, and determining to avenge  the slaughter of the van, and also anxious to rescue  those who still survived this murderous fire  from the invisible assailiants, ordered a large division  of the main body to ascend the height, and  forming there in two parties, to rush with fixed  bayonets into each of the ravines, and drive out  or destroy the concealed enemy. This corps  gallantly ascended to the scene of death, when  the firing was again opened with as much fury as  before. At the same time, the survivors of the  van were attacked from above by the French, under  De Villiers, and they fell hastily back upon <pb n="165"/> their companions, who were now fallen into too  much confusion to charge the enemy according  to their instructions. Dreading another volley,  every man of them who had not fallen, hastened  back from the fatal spot to the lower ground in  great terror.</p>

<p>This panic was communicated to the whole of  the regulars, who would soon have re-crossed the  river in full flight, had not their officers, by great  exertions restrained them. General Braddock,  who was now mad with vexation, and rage, rushed  in amongst them, exhorting them to perseverance,  and they were once more brought to stand their  ground.</p>

<p>At this crisis, Washington again interfered with  his advice, that the army should not attempt to  dislodge the assailants, but draw off from the  reach of their fire, and continue their route to  Fort Du Quesne, without paying these concealed  enemies any more attention.</p>

<p>But Braddock was resolved to take another  course. He detached about two hundred and fifty  men round, at some distance, by the left of the  ambush ground, in order to come upon the hidden  enemy in another direction, expecting by  that means to have them surrounded, at least to  get them hemmed in between two fires. This  movement, however, was soon discovered by De  Villiers, who seizing on a favourable position,  by which this detachment, he knew, must pass,  met it there, and cut every man of it off, without  on his side, losing a single soldier.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Braddock was resolved to  make a stronger, and, as he conceived, an irresistible  charge with his whole force upon the enemy.  He accordingly called upon his troops to  come on a third time, and leading the way himself,  he was followed by his devoted soldiers, and <pb n="166"/> the death-dealing ravines had victims once more  within their reach.</p>

<p>The French, however, were by this time, employed  with the detachment that had been sent  to take them in flank, so that Braddock's men in  place of having, as before, to sustain a fire from  three different directions, had now to sustain it only  from two, and would no doubt have dislodged  the savages from their concealment, had they  boldly pushed upon them with the bayonet the  moment they ascended the ground. But instead  of doing this, Braddock imprudently took time to  form them into two columns, with as much deliberation  and formality as if he were parading them  at a review in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>The consequence of this slowness of motion,  was to restore courage to the Indians, who, as  they were not now supported by the French, had  felt some intimidation from the eagerness with  which the British seemed to approach them, and  scarcely expected any thing else than destruction  in the very heart of their coverts. This  pause, however, restored their energy, and their  mortal fire again opened upon the troops. Here  one half of Braddock's officers were killed, he  himself had three horses successively shot under  him, and his whole division soon began to lose  that unfortunately compact array, into which he  had taken so much trouble to form them, and  which had only conduced to their more certain destruction.  In a short time they fell into absolute  confusion, and fled, some of them back to the  lower ground, and some forward to that lately  occupied by the French. Braddock was carried  back with the stream of those who fled in the  former direction; and near a spring immediately  beneath the point of the most western of the two  ravines, while attempting again to rally his <pb n="167"/> broken troops, he had a fourth horse shot under  him, and while he was mounting another, he received  a ball in his breast.</p>

<p>The Indians had seen him fall, and about a hundred  of them rushed out of the adjoining ravine, in  order to seize him. Washington, resolving at all  risks, to save his commander from the hands of  the savages, called forward Adderly with his  Virginians, who charged the Indians as they were  carrying off the body. A volley from the fatal ravine,  soon prostrated nearly one half of Adderly's  men; but Washington had by this time shot with  a pistol one of the Indians who was dragging  Braddock to the ravine, and plunged his sword into  the body of another, when his horse was killed  under him, and a dozen of shots fired at his head,  some of which perforated his hat, and carried  away its plumes and other parts of its decorations.  Adderly seeing his danger, rushed furiously forward  with the remnant of his company, to his rescue,  and buried his sword in the entrails of a  savage who was levelling a murderous aim at  Washington, within a few feet of him. The rifle  went off, but its direction had been changed by  Adderly's blow, and the ball only tore the epaulette  off Washington's left shoulder. In a moment  Washington was on another horse, when  perceiving that a number of Indians had again  laid hold of the wounded Braddock, he plunged  in among them with tremendous fury, and levelled  three or four of them to the earth with the irrisistible  sweeps of his broad-sword.</p>

<p>Another volley from the Indians, who perceived  that until he was destroyed, they could not capture  the general, now took place at his person.  His horse was again shot, and his coat perforated  in five or six places; and Adderly's few surviving  troops would not have been able to resist <pb n="168"/> the rush of Indians that was now made upon  him, had not another Virginia company, commanded  by a captain Poulson, given its timely assistance,  and the savages were once more driven  into their lurking place, not, however, until they  had unhorsed captain Adderly, and carried him,  together with five or six of his men, with them.</p>

<p>Washington now had Braddock placed in a  light tumbrel, which was convenient; and sending  it hastily off the field, put himself at the head of  the Virginians and such of the regulars as yet stood  their ground, in order to rescue a division which  was still on the fatal height between the gullies,  the object of attack from the Indians on the eastern  side. This party, about one hundred and seventy  in number, had, at the time their companions  fled back in confusion, rather advanced forward  to the ground lately occupied by the French,  so that they were for some time a short distance  beyond the reach of the Indian fire, but attempting  to return to assist their companions during the  struggle round Braddock, the Indians in the eastern  ravine so effectually fired upon them that they  were compelled to draw back. Their presence,  however, had the good effect of occupying these  Indians so as to prevent them from joining in the  contest for Braddock, in consequence of which  the Virginians succeeded in his rescue. But Braddock  was scarcely borne off the field, when the situation  of these men became extremely dangerous.  The French were seen returning in triumph after  the slaughter of the unfortunate detachment that  had been sent to take them in the rear, and the  Indians in both ravines, the contest for Braddock  being now abandoned, were impatiently waiting  to shower upon them their destructive balls as  soon as they approached near enough to be struck  by them.</p>

    <pb n="169"/>

<p>The active and vigilant eye of Washington soon  perceived their danger, and he resolved to release  them, or perish with them. About two hundred  of the regulars who could not be rallied when they  took to flight, had already recrossed the river, but  including his Virginians, there was still a force of  nearly three hundred on the ground.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Come on, my brave soldiers!" said he, "we  must rescue our companions yonder from impending  destruction. If we only give sufficient employment  to the savages in any of these ravines, our  soldiers may escape. Let us try this eastern one,  it appears the more easily assailable. Hark! the  French above yonder have fired upon our men already.  At it, my boys, and every man do his best  either by firing, or by the bayonet, to destroy the  savages. Widen your ranks---the less compactly  you rush on, the better---Forward!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>The soldiers gave a loud shout, for they now felt  confidence. Their companions on the upper  ground heard it, and returned it as a signal of cooperation.  In a minute the eastern ravine was  attacked. The savages fired out of it, but killed  only about twelve of the assailants, for the latter  were not now in such close order as to prevent  their balls from missing.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Keep these Indians in play, my brave fellows,  for some minutes," cried Washington, "and with  the blessing of God, I shall soon return to you."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he clapped spurs to his horse, and  ascended between the ravines at full flight towards  those he wished to rescue. Three gallant fellows  on horseback, named Peronny, Burton, and Craig,  voluntarily followed him. As he passed the length  of the ravines, a volley was fired at him from that  on the west, but he was at too great a distance  from it to be hurt by it. The attention of the savages  on the east was at this time so much <pb n="170"/> employed in resisting the attack of the troops, that they  scarcely attended to him. Several of them, however,  fired at him and his followers, two of whom.  Peronny and Burton were killed; but the swiftness  of Washington's horse, or rather the protecting  hand of a kind providence, saved him to his  country.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>The troops to whom he advanced received him  with a cheer. "Follow me rapidly," said he to them; "keep on this side, and shoot every savage  you can see as you fly past---but delay for  nothing!" He immediately turned his horse, and  galloped out of the dangerous ground, followed by  the whole party who discharged their muskets into  the eastern ravine, as they passed it with all their  speed. They only received some scattering shots  from the savages, which killed but one or two of  their number.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"To the bank of the river now, my brave  men!" cried Washington, to the whole of the  troops.</p>
            </quote>

<p>They obeyed him, and in a few minutes, he  there formed them into ranks, and ordered them  to reload their pieces, as he perceived that the Indians  manifested a disposition to pursue them. On  seeing the British thus prepared to receive them,  however, on open ground, neither the savages nor  the French thought proper to advance; and the  troops were safely conducted to the other side of  the river, where they were soon rejoined by those  who had previously fled from the engagement.</p>

<p>On reviewing the reliques of that fine body of  men, which, only a few hours before this disastrous  affair, expected that very evening to expel the  enemy from Fort Du Quesne, it was found that  out of twelve hundred, very little more than five  hundred remained, and of the officers only twenty  out of the eighty-five which they numbered before <pb n="171"/> the engagement, now survived. The artillery, all  the military stores, and baggage of every kind,  and even the private cabinet of General Braddock  which contained his instructions, were left in possession  of the enemy.</p>

<p>Of the Indians it has been ascertained that not  more than eight or ten were killed, and perhaps,  as many wounded, and of the French a still fewer  number. They had taken nearly forty prisoners,  independent of the wounded who could not retire  with their companions, and whom they carried that  evening into fort Du Quesne.</p>

<p>The defeated army being apprehensive that the  French would bring their whole force out of the  fort to pursue them, that very evening began a  precipitate retreat to the camp of Colonel Dunbar  at the Great Meadows. As they were nearly  destitute of provisions, Colonel Washington, who  seemed to be the life of the whole party, hastened  on before them in order to procure some, as well  as to order comfortable accommodations for them  when they should arrive. He made such dispatch  that he reached Dunbar's camp the evening of the  next day, procured the provisions, and by his inindefatigable  exertions, the wearied and disheartened  remnant of the troops were brought forward  in a few days without meeting with any fresh disaster.</p>   

<p>Shortly after his arrival at this place the unfortunate  Braddock died, and was buried on a hill,  where his grave is to be seen to this day.</p>

</lg>

<p>At this disastrous realization of his worst anticipations,  how did the heart of Washington bleed  within him! It bled indeed severely; but it did  not, as before the catastrophe, sink under the  pressure of the calamity. There is in the minds  of men, especially of brave men, an elasticity  which often strengthens them, so as to bear up  against any misfortune, however great, when it is  actually present, but which does not always exert  itself during the mere contemplation of an approaching  evil. Or, perhaps, the imagination being  more actively employed in depicting the horrors  of the evil before it comes, is apt to depict  them in their most gloomy and appalling colours,  so deeply and so strongly that the mind can scarcely  endure the picture. But the calamity being  present, the mind, as if it had nothing more to do  but to suffer, submits, undoubtedly with pain, but  often at the same time with fortitude.</p>

<p>Washington indeed felt keenly and sorrowfully  on this occasion. Nay, he had anticipations of  the most heart-breaking kind, even yet, to agonize  his soul. Alas! he feared that this defeat might  be attended with the worst of consequences to his <pb n="173"/>  Maria. He did not indeed suppose that the Indians  would offer any immediate violence to either  herself or her friends, with whom they had  so long lived on amicable terms. But there was  now no prospect of her soon being rescued from  that Wilderness of savages and licentious Frenchmen,  where every thing was ruled by violence and  caprice, and where he conceived that a beautiful  young female like her, could not, even in the  most tranquil times, be a single day safe from insult.</p>

<p>During the whole of the battle, her image never  had been absent from his mind; and sadly,  sadly, did he grieve that its catastrophe was likely  to be such as to preclude the possibility of his  enjoying only one minute's interview with her,  although her residence was in view of the very  ground on which he fought.</p>

<p>While mustering the defeated troops after conducting  them to the south shore of the river, he  cast his anxious eyes across the stream, and beheld  her, together with the rest of Frazier's family,  looking, he believed mournfully looking, at  the unfortunate army. He imagined that she  distinguished him. He bowed his head as he sat  on horseback, and he had the happiness to see  that she waved her hand in return. Gilbert, and  his sons took off their fur caps, and also returned  his salute. He even believed that he discerned  Gilbert, lifting his hands and face towards  heaven, as if to pray for his safety. His heart  burned within him to visit them, but his duty compelled  him to proceed almost instantaneously for  the Great Meadows. He again renewed his obeisance  to the family, and in a few minutes afterwards  set off.</p>

<p>He had scarcely proceeded out of view of the  troops, when he heard a voice calling him by <pb n="174"/> name. He stopped his horse, and the prophet  Tonnaleuka arose out of a thicket that was close  by him.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Beloved of heaven!" cried the prophet; "I  will not detain you, for I know your errand must  be one of haste. Alas, this has been a calamitous  day! I saw you escape in safety, and I thank  the Great Spirit. My son, Charles Adderly, has  not been so fortunate! But to what the Great  Being orders, we must submit. Farewell, my  son, I will not detain you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Father," said Washington, "if thou lovest me,  oh, watch over the safety of Maria! alas, she is  too beauteous and too tender a flower to be safe  amidst the storms of such a desert. Let me  know, wherever I may be, if aught befalls her."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I shall watch over her," said the prophet,  "and shall let you know if she be unfortunate.  I concealed myself here that I might salute, and  bless you, as you passed. Farewell, and may the  God whom you worship still protect you, as he  has done this day!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Farewell, father," replied Washington; and  the prophet disappearing among the bushes, he  continued his journey with a heart greatly relieved  by this short interview.</p>
            </quote>

<p>The feelings of Maria, and indeed of all Frazier's  family, during the momentous scenes which  had been that day acted within their immediate  view, may be easily imagined by any reader of a  good heart, who reflects upon their circumstances  and situation. Gilbert's whole soul was with his  countrymen; and his heart warmed when he beheld  their red uniforms.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"Ah, Nelly!" said he, "they are something  like Christian soldiers. They put me in min' o'  Ireland and Maughrygowan. Oh, may God help  them against the savages!"</p>
            </quote>

    <pb n="175"/>

<quote rend="Nelly Frazier"><p>"Amen," said Nelly; and she lifted her eyes  to heaven to add fervency to the prayer.</p>
            </quote>

<p>As to Paddy Frazier and doctor Killbreath,  the vigilance of the French prevented them during  the whole of the preceding spring, from venturing  to manifest their partiality for the British  cause by any active exertion in its favour; and during  the whole of these transactions, they had  preserved a very prudent, though very reluctant  neutrality. From the accounts they had heard  of the force that was coming against Fort Du  Quesne, they indeed believed that the British  were now strong enough to do their own business  effectually, without their assistance; and  from the appearance of the army when it approached,  they were confirmed in this belief.  They knew nothing of the ambuscade, for it had  been laid in the night, and De Villiers had been  so cautious as to communicate the scheme to none  but those who were to be employed in its execution.  They were, therefore, greatly disappointed,  grieved, and shocked, at the result of  the memorable battle of which they had been  spectators.</p>

<p>But who can speak the agony of Maria's mind  during the incessant peals of rifles and musketry,  which, for three long hours, rang in her ears, and  seemed to her imagination to carry destruction  to every thing within their reach. She knew that  her Charles was among the combatants; she had  with an anxious and affectionate eye singled him  out, as seated upon his prancing steed he led his  company of rangers across the river, and her  view had followed him until the firing commenced,  when her alarm and agitation became so great  that, unable to behold more, she was obliged to  retire to her chamber.</p>

    <pb n="176"/>

<p>When she was informed that the troops were  recrossing the river, with the hope of again seeing  her beloved Charles, she hastened to the  porch before the house, from which the rest of  the family were viewing the scene. Here she  perceived Washington, and returned his salute  as before-mentioned. But she perceived not  Charles, and in a few minutes she returned to her  chamber, in a state of dreadful suspense as to his  fate.</p>

<p>She was in this situation when Mrs. Killbreath  informed her that the French commander was in  the house, and had expressed a wish to see her.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Tell him, my dear Nancy," said she, "that I  am really indisposed. The horrible scenes of this  day have rendered me incapable of seeing any  body. Oh, Nancy, Nancy! God only knows how  terribly my heart is at this moment torn with suspense  and agony!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>Nancy made her apology to De Villiers. It  was of too reasonable a nature not to be believed,  and he was of too gallant a temper not to admit  it. He observed, "that he was not surprised at  her being terrified, and he was very sorry that the  affair had taken place so near her; but he hoped  that both Miss Frazier, and the whole family, in  whose welfare he protested himself to feel greatly  interested, would have recovered from their terrors  by the time he should next have the pleasure  of visiting them." He then partook of some refreshments  with which Mrs. Frazier presented him,  and returned to the field of battle, where the victors  were busily employed, some scalping the  slain, and others collecting the spoil. He soon  called them together, and as the day was considerably  advanced, the greater part of the Indians  accompanied him to Fort Du Quesne, which they  reached, in triumph, towards the evening.</p>
            </quote>

    <pb n="177"/>

<p>Not Maria, alone, but the whole of Frazier's  family, felt anxious to ascertain the fate of Charles  Adderly, whom they had seen advancing to the  fight, but not returning from it. As soon therefore,  as the victors had withdrawn from the field, Paddy,  Archy, and Doctor Killbreath, hastened there  to ascertain the number of the slain, and whether  their friend Charles was among them.</p>

<p>What a melancholy and shocking appearance  this spot of ground now presented to their view!  Hundreds of human beings, who had that morning  rejoiced in all the vigour of health, and strength,  and buoyant spirits, now lay prostrate before  them, either already cold and insensible as the  earth on which they were stretched, or else were  writhing and convulsed in the last tortures of expiring  animation. Some had their brains scattered  beside them, and had expired on the instant;  others had received balls in their breasts or their  bowels, or other vital parts, which left them in  torment to linger out a few tedious hours of agonized  existence.</p>

<p>Into the bodies of the greater portion of these  last, the Indians, either for the cruel purpose of  gratifying a malignancy of feeling, by making sure  of their destruction, or from the more humane  motive of more speedily putting an end to their  sufferings, had plunged bayonets, and driven tomakawks,  occasioning wounds through which the  bowels of many had protruded, and lay scattered,  and often mangled, upon the blood-stained grass  beside them. Upon every one of these unfortunate  men, the scalping knife had performed its  barbarous office, and where the skull had not been  broken to pieces by a shower of bullets, it had  been stripped of its natural covering, in order to  furnish the savage conquerors with trophies of  their victory.</p>

    <pb n="178"/>

<p>The conquerors, although they had carried off  a great proportion of the spoil, had still left a considerable  quantity behind; enough, indeed, to  have made the fortunes of Frazier's family, had  they chosen to avail themselves of it. But at  this time, the feelings of even Paddy himself, who  was not in general very scrupulous in such matters,  were so much affected and shocked to behold  such an awful havoc made upon human beings,  that all mercenary feelings were stifled in  his breast, and he could not carry away a single  article.</p>

<p>On numbering the slain, they found them to  amount to nearly seven hundred---but they had  the satisfaction not to find Charles Adderly  among them. They returned home with this intelligence,  which was soon imparted to Maria  by Mrs. Killbreath, and she was inspired with  the hope that providence might yet have preserved  him for better times.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, Nancy!" said she, "although you know  the secret of my heart---little, little can you imagine  what I this afternoon have suffered. Oh!  had they found him there mangled with the rest  of these murdered men, I feel that a few days  would have terminated my sufferings, and you  would have burried me in the same grave with  him I loved. Alas! I am not yet altogether relieved  of my apprehension; but I will trust---Oh!  I will pray, fervently pray, to my God for his preservation."</p>
            </quote>   

<p>She here requested Nancy to kneel with her,  and then with great agitation after thanking the  Deity for the gleam of hope which he had allowed  to dawn upon her mind, she implored him "to  prevent it from being at last totally extinguished  by the destruction of the youth, upon whose preservation  her own so entirely depended."</p>

    <pb n="179"/>

<p>She had scarcely finished, when she heard the  voice of Tonnaleuka in the outer room.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, Nancy!" said she, "if there be comfort  on earth for me, that holy man can administer it.  Would to heaven, that all Indians had hearts like  his! Tell him, my sister, that I wish to see  him."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>Tonnaleuka was soon with her. "Oh, father," said she, "how I feel relief in your presence,  from the torments which this terrible day  has inflicted upon my mind. I thank God, that  you, at least, have met with no misfortune."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter," said the prophet. "Much,  indeed, have I felt for your situation to day; for  I knew the agony you would suffer in consequence  of these bloody deeds. The youth whom you  love was in the midst of them; but be comforted,  for he did not fall, neither is he a prisoner in  Fort Du Quesne. But I shall before many hours  discover the direction that his captors have taken,  and the great Spirit, I doubt not, will protect  him."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Daughter, dry your tears!" ---(for Maria at this  time wept violently, which afforded her feelings a  relief that the scorching agony of her soul had before  prevented her from receiving.) "This storm  will blow away. A calm will succeed, and sunshine  will yet---for the Great Spirit is just---gild  your course, and compensate for these afflictions.  One noble and glorious youth has this day been  miraculously preserved by his care, amidst the  thunder that pealed around him, and blasted hundreds  by his side. My daughter, Washington is  safe, and the Father of the world has shown kindness  to men."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I know it, Father," she replied. "I have  beheld that excellent young man out of reach of  the foes, whom, I am told, he alone restrained in <pb n="180"/> their murderous career, and amidst the intensity  of my other griefs, I felt consolation at the  sight."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, I rejoice that you so respect  this hero, although you know not half his virtues,  half his worth to the world---that world which the  Great Being has not forsaken since he has spared  him to it; for my daughter, while he lives the  cause of mankind may suffer, but need never  despair."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I know, Father," she replied, "that great  public good is likely to result from Colonel Washington's  career, if Providence prolongs it. I am  sensibly aware of his worth, greatly do I rejoice  in his safety, and ardently do I hope for his  prosperity. But ah, there are griefs that, at  present, come closer to my heart. Charles Adderly---  Oh, Father! is he not in danger, and  can I be in comfort!---Alas, alas, I cannot!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, I know your heart, I will not  therefore blame your feelings. I sympathize with  them. Charles Adderly I esteem, I love---for he  is worthy of both. But I despair not of his deliverance  from danger. The Great Spirit preserved  him once, when in as much peril as now,  and he is as mighty to save as ever."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, I again ask you to be of good  cheer---I must now leave you. I go to discover  where they have taken him for whom you grieve.  Farewell!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Farewell!" she replied. "And oh, may  the God of all things grant success to your exertions!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria's mind was greatly quieted by the encouragement  to hope which she derived from this  interview; and during the remainder of the evening,  she appeared tranquil, and joined the rest of <pb n="181"/>  the family in their conversation on the disasters  of the day.</p>

<p>When retired to rest, however, her disquietude  returned. She was long wakeful and restless;  and when at length she fell into a slumber, it was  to experience the horrors of a frightful dream.  She thought she was wandering alone along the  bank of Turtle Creek, meditating upon the virtues,  the tenderness, and the misfortunes of Charles,  when she suddenly heard the noise of a mighty  rush of waters; she cast her eyes up the stream,  and perceived a terrible and overwhelming flood  rolling down the valley, and sweeping every thing  before it with great violence towards the place  where she stood. She instinctively attempted to fly  out of its course, but was unable---she seemed  spell-bound to the spot, until the waters came upon  her, and were rapidly carrying her on their surface  towards the river, when a terrific, monstrouslooking  animal, half man, and half bear, rushed  headlong from the eastern heights, into the flood,  and swimming towards her, seized her in his  mouth, and making his way with her to dry land,  in a few minutes deposited her in a chamber, in  Fort Du Quesne. It then addressed her in the  human voice:</p>

<quote rend="Monster"><p>"Look out of that casement, and behold a feast  which gladdens my eyes," said the monster.--- "I must away to enjoy it." She looked out, and  beheld her lover, Charles Adderly, bound hand  and foot, with iron chains, and seated on a high  pile of wood, to which a number of savages were  setting fire in several places, by the direction of  the monster. The next moment the flames seemed  suddenly to ascend in mighty volumes round  her lover. She gave a scream, and awoke  in dreadful agony.</p>
            </quote>

    <pb n="182"/>
 
<p>Mrs. Killbreath, whom the scream had alarmed,  hastened into her room to inquire what was the  matter.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, my dear sister!" cried Maria all trembling; "I have been terribly frightened---do not  leave me! I beg thee! do not leave me till the  morning. I have had a dreadful dream---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nancy Killbreath"><p>"Be composed---Maria!" said her sister.---  "This is owing to yesterday's alarm! You  should not lay these things so much to heart.

<p>Nancy did so.---But Maria slept no more that  night; for she feared to experience such another  vision. The presence of her sister, however,  and the exertions of her own reason, enabled her  by the time the day dawned, to become once more  considerably soothed and tranquilized in her  feelings.</p>

<p>The charms of Maria had made too deep an  impression upon the mind of the governor of Du  Quesne to permit him to delay long the repetition  of his visit to Frazier's. His reflections upon her  had kept him awake almost the whole night.</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"How in the name of heaven!" thought he,  "have I been so long ignorant of such a lovely  creature residing so near me! Such a jewel in such  a Wilderness! But I am a fortunate man to have  discovered her at last. I will make her my wife,  for it would be worse than villany to pollute so  much purity! nor do I suppose it would be so easy  a matter, for she appears as modest as she is beautiful.  By heavens, I will seriously offer her my  hand. She surely cannot refuse to become mistress  of Fort Du Quesne; and I shall be happy in  the enjoyment of such a treasure! I wish the  morning was come, for I will not be content till I  know her mind, and till I have made her my own  property."</p>
            </quote>

<p>In the morning he accordingly, at an early hour,  set off for Frazier's. Maria had walked out upon  the bank of Turtle Creek, with the expectation of  deriving some assistance from the tranquillity and  beauty of the scene, in soothing the sorrow that  lay so heavy at her heart. He perceived her <pb n="184"/> before he came to the house; and tying his horse  to a tree, he approached her on foot ere she was  aware.</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>He bowed politely to her, and smiling pleasantly,  addressed her--- "Miss Frazier, I am really  happy to meet you here all alone, in this charming  place. I hope you have recovered from your  yesterday's fright. I could not be easy, I assure  you, without coming to see whether you had  thrown it off."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You are very kind, sir," said she; "but I  presume you had more important business to bring  you here at so early an hour, than merely to inquire  after the state of a stranger's mind."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Upon my honour, Miss Frazier, no other  business in the world than just to see, and to converse  with you, brought me from fort Du Quesne  this morning. Ah! believe me, my charming  girl! I think no business in the world half so sweet  or so important as enjoying your society. I wish  to God I had only known you sooner, we should  by this time have understood each other better."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"It might readily enough have been so," she  replied, looking at him with an expression of surprise;  "for I protest, sir, that I cannot understand  you now."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Ah! my dear Miss Frazier, you may say so, but  I cannot believe you---your pretty tell-tale eyes  say that you understand well the nature of my  visit. How can you mistake it! But I will  make it plainer to you. Ever since I first saw  you, I have been so fascinated, I could think of  nothing else. I feel as if there was nothing else  worth thinking of. Even the hurry of the battle  yesterday could not drive you for a moment from  my thoughts, and as soon as the enemy was driven  off, I hastened to see you. Ah, I feel as if I  could live by looking upon you!"</p>
            </quote>

    <pb n="185"/>
 

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You would derive very little benefit from  such diet," she answered, scarcely thinking it  worth while to reply seriously to such language;  "and I am afraid that before long you should find  it very little to your satisfaction."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Nay, Miss Frazier," said he in a fond tone,  "by my soul, these pretty cheeks, those ruby lips,  those sparkling eyes---ah! you may banter me,  and laugh at me if you choose, but, by heavens, I  never saw any thing in the world I loved half so  much to gaze upon!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Monsieur De Villiers," said she, "my heart  is too much laden with sorrow at present, to laugh  at any thing, otherwise, I believe, that such unmeaning,  such frivolous, and pardon me, if I say,  such ridiculous nonsense, would provoke my mirth.  It is, sir, equally beneath your dignity, and unsuited  to the present state of my feelings."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Ah, my pretty banterer!" returned the  Frenchman, not in the least disconcerted, "then  I shall speak seriously to you. Your charms have  warmed my heart to a sincere, uncontrollable  passion. I love you, by heavens I adore you! ah,  I have never seen a woman I could love as I do  you!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, "this language seems as mad  as what you just now uttered was foolish. Both, I  must say, are unworthy of you, and disagreeable  to me."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Pardon me, madam," he returned. "Can it  be unworthy of me to love so much excellence!  No---by all that is sacred, I swear, that if I were  the grand monarch himself, I should think you  worthy to share my throne. I love you, Miss Frazier,  with an honourable passion, at which the  most sainted purity could not take offence. My  hand is free, my fortune respectable, my heart devoted  to you. I offer you them all, and shall feel <pb n="186"/> myself the happiest of mortals if you accept of  them."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," she answered, "I thank you for being  so explicit, and candid with me. I will consider  you to be serious in these liberal offers, and shall  be explicit, candid, and serious in reply to them.  Then hear my reply, and set it down on the tablets  of your memory, as one which neither your power,  nor even that of your grand monarch himself,  should he lend you his aid, will ever induce me to  alter---I utterly and decisively reject them."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"You do!" said he, beginning to feel that he  did not stand on such eligible ground with her as  he had supposed. "Then it exactly comes to this  issue, my fair tempter, that as I feel I cannot live  without you, you must become mine in spite of  yourself. But I wish for your voluntary consent;  for, upon my honour, I should be very loth to compel  you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," she replied, "we may as well drop the  conversation. My voluntary assent to your proposals  you never can have. In the attempt to  pronounce it my tongue would wither in my mouth.  With respect to compelling me, you cannot be so  irrationally wicked. You cannot be so devoid of  good sense as to expect that compulsion will ever  produce affection; nay, you must know that the  excitement of absolute abhorrence would, it is  more than probable, be its consequence."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Then tell me, fair one, what I am to do!" asked De Villiers, checking a strong tendency  which he felt towards irritation. "Tell me how I  shall obtain thee, thou ensnarer of my senses! for  obtain thee I must. Without thee my life will be  nothing---worse than nothing---it will be a burthen I  will not be able to bear. But, by all my hopes of  salvation, thou shalt be mine, if I should---but  no," he said, suddenly changing his manner, "I <pb n="187"/> will not say it, I will not resolve it, for I cannot resolve  upon any thing offensive to thee. Oh! consent  to my proposals, become my wife, and live  happily with a man who adores, who shall for ever  adore thee."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, "you have my answer already.  It is final, unalterable, and need not be repeated."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Then," said he, "proud girl! either you or I,  or perhaps both of us, are doomed to wretchedness.  Permit me, at least, to kiss your hand before you  drive me off in despair."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here he violently seized her hand, and pressed  it forcibly to his lips. Her soul filled with  indignation and horror at his rudeness; but fearing  to prolong his stay by making any observation  concerning it, she meekly turned from him when  he loosened his hold, and without making any reply  to his farewell, hastened back to the house  in great perplexity and alarm. Having taken his  resolution as to the measures he should adopt, he  did not follow her, but the more to lull any suspicion  of his design, he rode up the glen of Turtle  Creek, and returned hastily to Du Quesne, by a  direction different from the one he came.</p>

<p>She hesitated when she reached home, whether  she should communicate the incident to her  friends. She did not wish to excite in their minds  any unnecessary uneasiness; and she entertained  hopes that as the governor had received so decided  a refusal, he might see the futility of his pursuit,  and disturb her no more. It is true, he threw  out some expressions indicative of a resolution to  persevere in his designs upon her. But these expressions  might only be the common-place protestations  of a man wishing to make an impression  on a woman whom he found difficult to persuade;  or, they might only be the sudden and  unreflecting effusions of the moment. At any rate, <pb n="188"/> how could her friends, few and powerless as they  were, resist the Governor of Fort Du Quesne,  if he should think proper to follow the import of  his insinuations? They might, indeed, contribute  to her concealment, until he should either forget  her, or be removed from his post. But this might  bring down his vengeance upon them; and even  should her concealment be necessary, by the aid  of Tonnaleuka alone, could it be effectually accomplished.  To lay the case before him, and be  regulated by his advice, she believed would, upon  the whole, be her wisest course; and she concluded  on not disturbing the serenity of her friends  by acquainting them with the incident, until she  consulted him to whom she had always been accustomed  to look up for advice in every perplexity.</p>   

<p>As to De Villiers there was nothing further  from his intention than to relinquish his pursuit  after her. He saw clearly that nothing was to be  obtained from her by mere solicitation; and he  was determined not to expend time and labour  in vain. His passion for her was too violent to  brook such a delay. He therefore resolved to  have recourse to active and prompt measures;  and he was only sorry that he had happened,  while conversing with her, to throw out hints that  might put her on her guard against the attempt  he meditated. But this consideration formed a  motive, additional to the urgency of his passion,  to have his design immediately executed, so that  she might not have time to adopt any mode of  frustrating it.</p>

<p>He therefore, as soon as he returned to the  garrison, ordered a Lieutenant Ranttell, a man  whom he knew to be fit for his purpose, into his  presence.</p>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Well, Ranttell!" said he.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"What! not Doctor Killbreath's wife, I hope,"  cried Ranttell; "but no matter," he added, winking  significantly at the Governor, "sweet's the eye  upon a pretty girl, whether married or single."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"You mistake," said the Governor, affecting  some offence at this insinuation: "do you think  me such a blackguard as to seduce another man's  wife?---no---no, Lieutenant, you mistake the matter."</p>
            </quote>   

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"I beg pardon," returned the Lieutenant, "but I am glad the Doctor is out of the scrape at any  rate, for he cured me of the cholic last spring,  when our own bungling surgeon could scarce tell  what ailed me. But I suppose it is the pretty  rosy-lipped, sweet countenanced lady, the Doctor's  sister-in-law, that I saw last winter when out <pb n="190"/> in that quarter on a hunting trip. By the Lord,  she's a dainty. Had I been the Doctor, I know  which of the two sisters I should have chosen for  a help-mate."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Perfect logic, your honour," replied Ranttell.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>"Well, sir," said De Villiers, "you know the  lady---I love her to distraction---I wish to marry  her---she's an angel, and I would not for the world  pollute her. I told her so, but she is rather shy  about the matter. I want you to bring her here,  as I think I could here persuade her with more  effect, than in the woods under her father's wing  yonder. You neither need ask her consent, nor  that of any of her friends. Take twenty smart  fellows with you, enter the house boldly, and  bring her off without question. But, take care,  Ranttell! offer her no insult, as you would avoid  getting a ball through your brains. Remember,  she is to be my wife."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"It shall be all done as fairly and politely, as  you would ask her to dance a rigadoon," replied  the Lieutenant. "But when shall we set out,  Monsieur Le Governor?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Monsieur De Villiers"><p>De Villiers pulled out a watch, "by my faith,  but I made good speed this morning," said he. "It  is not twelve yet. In half an hour, Ranthell, be  off. Give each man a dose of rum before you  start, and another when you come in sight of your  destination, and I shall expect you back by sundown.  Good morning---be polite to the lady, and  civil to the family."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"I'll manage it as neat as a new made plume  in a grenadier's cap," said the lieutenant, bowing <pb n="191"/> several times almost to the ground as he withdrew.</p>
            </quote>   

<p>It was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon,  when Archy Frazier, who had been in  the woods at some distance to the westward of  the house, came in hastily, with intelligence that  a party of French soldiers were in sight. Maria,  who was in her own apartment, for she had scarcely  stirred out of it ever since the rencontre with  De Villiers, did not hear this intelligence, as the  rest of the family did not think proper to disturb  her by communicating it. They ran to the door,  rather from an impulse of curiosity than alarm;  and unconscious that any of themselves were to  be the objects of his violence, they met Ranttell  rather cordially than otherwise, as, ordering the  body of his men to keep at a distance, unless  called forward, he, with only three soldiers, advanced  to the house. Paddy and Doctor Killbreath,  had gone in the morning on a hunting  excursion, and were not expected back till  night. Gilbert and Archy, therefore, were the  only male part of the family present; and for any  opposition he might meet with from these, Lieutenant  Ranttell cared but little. As neither Gilbert  nor Nelly could speak French, Mrs. Killbreath  had to return his salutation and answer his  interrogations.</p>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Good day! my friend Frazier! My best wishes for your family," was the first salutation, which  was accompanied with a ceremonious bow.</p>

<quote rend="Nancy Killbreath"><p>"We thank you," replied Nancy, "but as my  father does not speak French, you will excuse  his silence."</p>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"With all my heart, Mrs. Killbreath. But pray,  my sweet madam, where are all the rest of your  people? I hope our fighting here yesterday, has  not frightened them away."</p>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Excuse me, ladies!" said he, bowing and  smiling very politely to Maria; "excuse me for this unmannerly intrusion. But I must plead the  necessity I am under of obeying my commander."  "My dear madam," said he, addressing Maria exclusively,  "I have to inform you of Governor  De Villiers's request that you will honour him  with your company, this evening, at fort Du Quesne.  I have been ordered out with a party of soldiers  to escort you there."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, alas!" exclaimed Maria, in violent agitation,  without making any direct reply to Ranttell; "I see I am undone---Oh!

I might have concealed myself,  but I could not think he would have perpetrated  such instantaneous violence. Oh, my God,  preserve me!"</p>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Nor does the Governor, my sweet madam,  wish, or intend to do any thing either to injure or  offend her.

But we must be off, madam, and please let us go in good humour together;  for, confound me, if I like to be at variance with a  lady."</p>

<!--The following portion of The Wilderness was encoded by Panya Lyons!-->

<p>Here Gilbert could endure no longer; his rage  entirely overpowered his reason, and running into  an adjacent room, he seized upon an axe that  happened to be there.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"I'll cleave you to the yearth this moment,"  cried he to Ranttell, "if you get not oot, an' no  vex my bairn in this gate---" and he actually  wielded a blow which would have been fatal to  the lieutenant, had not one of the soldiers who  had entered the house with him, caught the axe  ere it descended, and attempted to wrest it out  of his grasp. Gilbert however, although advanced  in life, was still a strong man, and in a moment  overturned the soldier. But another of the  soldier's seized upon the axe, and had it just extricated  from Gilbert's hold, when Archy Frazier  hearing the scuffle, darted forward upon him and  with a kick upon the stomach overturned him  upon his companion. Ranttell himself now closed  with Archy, and the third soldier having called  forward the remainder of the troops, hastened to  assist his commander, and Archy was soon overpowered.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Ranttell, as soon as the troops came forward,  ordered a sergeant's guard to enter the house, and  Gilbert and his son were instantly tied, hands and  feet together, with ropes.</p>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Now, my fair maiden," said he, (running to  Maria, who had just recovered from a swoon, for  she thought her father was killed,) "the day is  our own---let us be going.

<p>Mrs. Killbreath took the hint; but first throwing  her arms round Maria's neck, she kissed her,  while her eyes overflowed with tears---</p>

<quote rend="Nancy Killbreath"><p>"Farewell, my dearest, dearest sister!" said she. "And oh! may God deliver you from these  men."</p>
            </quote>

<p>She then hastened to pack up some clothing for  Maria, which when done she handed to the lieutenant.  While Nancy was thus employed, Maria  had alternately embraced her father and mother.  She was at length separated from them, and <pb n="197"/> proceeded so far as the porch, when Nelly running after  her, again caught her in her arms.</p>

<quote rend="Nelly Frazier"><p>"Oh! my bairn, my lovely bairn! I canna let  you leave me. I will go wi' you. Where'er they  pit you, canna be owre bad for me. I will watch  owre you, an' comfort ye amang the soldiers."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"My mother, I know not what to do," said Maria; "much could I wish they would permit you  to go with me, but I fear it would break your  heart to witness my misery."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nelly Frazier"><p>"Alack!" returned Nelly; "it will break my  heart to think of my bairn being in distress, an'  me no' wi' her to share it, an' to comfort her."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Lieutenant Ranttell"><p>"Pardon me, ladies!" said Ranttell; "but we  have no time now to discuss matters; and as my  instructions relate only to one lady, I believe I  shall be, at present, so moderate as not to exceed  them. So, my good mother, you had better walk  within doors, and pacify old crack-brain yonder,  who will no doubt pronounce many a solid curse  upon us before we reach Du Quesne. But, my  sweet fair one! you were the prize I was sent to  capture; be so good, therefore, as to come along.  Yon gallant steed impatiently champs his bit, as  if he longed for his lovely burthen."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nelly Frazier"><p>He here separated her from the clinging arms  of her mother, who exclaiming, "Oh, heavenly  God! my bairn! my bairn! my lovely, my innocent  bairn, is lost!" and she fell flat upon the  porch in a state of insensibility.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria with a bursting heart, and a burning  brain, was soon raised upon the horse prepared  for her, and the troops with their beauteous prize,  hastened back to Fort Du Quesne.</p>

<p>Gilbert and his wife felt the calamity that had  on this day befallen them the more acutely, as they  had, since their settlement in the Wilderness, experienced  nothing of the kind. Their children<pb n="198"/> had grown up under their eyes, healthy, blooming,  and prosperous; and, in all their other affairs, they  had enjoyed such a uniform course of tranquillity  and success, such an uninterrupted continuance of  comfort and repose, that now when the storm of  misfortune burst upon them all at once, and struck  them so severely in their tenderest affections, it is  not wonderful that they were scarcely able to endure  the shock.</p>

<p>Gilbert and his son were soon loosened by Mrs.  Killbreath from their bonds after the French departed;  but the folly of giving pursuit was too apparent  for them to attempt it, and all they could  do was to weep bitterly for their lost Maria.</p>

<p>As for Nelly, it was a considerable time after  her fall upon the porch, before she was restored  to sensation, and when that was effected, it was  found that her mind had sustained such a shock as  to render her delirious. They laid her in bed, for  she was in a high fever, and Gilbert had no other  expectation during this sorrowful evening, but that  he had lost both his wife and his daughter for ever.</p>

<p>As he looked upon Nelly in her raving moments,  rage and vexation would sometimes overpower  him, and he would involuntarily exclaim---</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"Heaven's curse upon the fiends! they hae  ruined me, an' a' my comforts!---But God forgie  me, I should curse nae yen. I leave them to thy  hands, oh Lord! Deal wi' them according to thy  own pleasure; but oh! have compassion upon  this afflicted family. Protect my bairn, an' restore  my wife!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>It was late in the evening when Nelly's mind  became so much tranquilized that she began to  relish the consolations of religion, and Gilbert was  sitting by her bedside reading the following passage  of the version of the 4th psalm used by the  Church of Scotland:</p>

<pb n="199"/>

<p>"In thy great indignation, O Lord! rebuke me not,  Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand, In thy displeasure hot.  Lord, I am weak, therefore on me Have mercy, and me spare;  Heal me, O Lord, because thou know'st                        My bones much vexed are---" when the prophet Tonnaleuka entered, on his  return from inquiring after the direction which  had been taken by the savages who captured  Charles Adderly. He had ascertained it, and was  now coming to report the circumstance to Maria,  and comfort her with the assurance, that something  should be immediately done to effect her lover's  deliverance.</p>

<p>The prophet was thunderstruck, when he was  informed of what had happened to the family. He  gave a groan, and threw himself in great agitation  upon a bench beside a table upon which he laid his  head, and pressing his throbbing temples between  his hands, remained in that posture for about fifteen  minutes, without speaking a word. He then  suddenly started up, and hastily paced the room  backwards and forwards for some time in a species  of frenzy, with his eyes swollen as if they  would burst from their sockets, but apparently too  much scorched with the fire of grief to shed a single  tear. After which he resumed his former posture  at the table, still silent, and seemingly absorbed  in intense thought, as well as grief. At length  throwing himself upon his knees, he stretched his  hands, and lifted his burning eyes towards heaven,  and exclaimed---</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Oh! Great Spirit and Father of the universe,  assist me in the endeavour, and grant success to  what thou hast thyself suggested. I depend on  thee, on thee alone to protect that suffering maiden  and restore her again to her friends."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="200"/>

<p>He then arose, and inquired for Paddy Frazier;  and when told that Paddy had not been at home  since the morning, he seemed very impatient, and  again paced the floor in great agitation.</p>

<p>In a short time, however, Paddy and Dr. Killbreath  arrived, and Tonnaleuka appeared at once  to become much tranquilized. The consternation  and rage of both these hunters of the forest,  when they heard of their sister's misfortune, need  not be described: they both swore eternal hatred  to the French. But Tonnaleuka did not give Paddy  much time to vent forth the vehemence of his  rage; he took him out of doors, where he communed  with him about ten minutes. When they  re-entered the house, Paddy hastily provided himself  with a small wooden flask full of rum and  some provisions, which he deposited in a pouch at  his side, and pitching his rifle on his shoulder,  set off again at full speed, with as much briskness  and alacrity as if he had just arisen from  his couch, after the enjoyment of a long repose.</p>

<p>The prophet then exhorted the family to be of  good cheer, as he had great hopes that all might yet  be well; and as he understood from Mrs. Killbreath  that her father and mother had refused all kinds of  nourishment since Maria's capture, he desired that  supper should be prepared, of which, he said, he  should himself stay to partake. After supper, he  took Dr. Killbreath aside and requested him to set  off early in the morning towards the head waters  of Chartier's Creek, in order to watch the proceedings  of a party of Caughnewago Indians, who had  carried Charles Adderly in that direction, and  to lose no time in bringing him back intelligence  of their intentions concerning their prisoner, as  soon as he should discover them.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son," said he, "show this wampum to the  sachem, Takshuma, who is their leader. He will <pb n="201"/> protect you from any injury, and perhaps, give you  all the information we require. I should have  gone on this errand myself; but, Maria, the child  of my heart, is now in distress, and I cannot forsake  her."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, my inability to attend to the affairs of  Charles Adderly, may, at this crisis, be fatal to him,  unless Takshuma grants the petition which, in my  name, and upon the testimony of that sacred wampum,  I authorize you to deliver to him.---Tell him  that Tonnaleuka, the adopted son of the deceased  Fallakamsah, formerly chief sachem of the tribe of  the Mingoes, and the prophet of Maneto for fifteen  tribes, requests Takshuma, sachem of the Caughnewagoes,  to grant the English prisoner Charles Adderly,  if the Caughnewago counsellors should condemn  him to be burned, that which no prophet of  Maneto has ever been refused when he asked it  for a condemned prisoner---namely, seven days after  his condemnation to make his peace with Maneto  before he be given to the flames."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"If I had this petition in writing," observed the  Doctor, with much simplicity, "I should, no doubt,  remember it better, and deliver it more correctly  to the sachem."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My son, you shall have it in writing then," said  Tonnaleuka, "for your own use. Only show not  the paper to the sachem, for he will either despise  you for requiring such as assistant to your memory,  or he may look upon it as a forgery of your  own, for the chiefs and prophets of our people never  use such means of communication with each  other."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The Doctor promised to obey the prophet's instructions,  which, as well as the petition, were  reduced that evening to writing, and he set out  on his errand early the next morning.</p>

<p>The great luminary of this nether world had  upwards of an hour's journey to perform, ere he  could hide himself behind the edge of the western  horizon, from the view of the inhabitants  of Fort Du Quesne, when the lovely object of  its Governor's passion, was brought an unhappy  captive within its walls.</p>

<p>When the sound of the bugle announced the  arrival of Ranttell's party, the Governor, with a  feeling of some embarrassment, hastened to salute  the enchanter of his soul, whom he perceived  to be with them, and to conduct her unto his  residence. When he held out his hand to assist  her in dismounting, she for a moment, with an instinctive  shudder, shrunk from his touch; but instantly  recollecting that there was no possibility  of then avoiding it, without perhaps, subjecting  herself to greater rudeness, she silently accepted  his assistance, and suffered herself to be led, an  uncomplaining victim, to the lodging that had  been prepared for her.</p>

<p>This was a tolerably neat room of moderate  dimensions, on the second floor of the governor's  house, which was situated near that part of the  circumvallation which overlooked the <pb n="203"/> Monongahela. It was in the northeastern angle of the  house, and had in view from its front windows,  the principal area, or parade ground, within the  stoccade. Besides the necessary furniture which,  although not splendid, was commodious and clean,  it contained a few books of a romantic and light  species of literature, arranged on some shelves  adjoining the door of a small dark closet, which  formed an appendage to the apartment.</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Miss Frazier," said De Villiers on handing  her into this room, "I am sorry, to my very soul I  am sorry, that you should have compelled me  to take this step. But I felt that I could not  live without you, and I had no alternative. Endeavour  to make yourself comfortable in this  abode, such as it is, I wish to God it was a palace  for your sake."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, comfort is now a matter of no  concern to me, for it is what I feel I cannot enjoy.  Alas! to enter a place under such circumstances,  would be the same as a dungeon."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here the energy which had sustained her during  her journey, forsook her, for the state in  which she had left her friends, rushed into her  remembrance, and she burst into tears."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, my dear father and mother," said she,  "what must you not feel at this moment! heaven  support you under this trial."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Be pacified, my lovely maiden," said De Villiers,  in a soothing manner---for he really felt affected  at her sorrow. "Your feelings are too  tender. You are by far of too timid and apprehensive  a disposition. I assure you that you will  suffer no evil here, and shall also take care to remove  any uneasiness your friends may feel on  that account. The urgency of passion, irresistible  passion, for you, alone, constrained me to <pb n="204"/> separate you from them. But, believe me, it was  not to make either you or them unhappy; and,  upon the honour of a soldier, I promise that any  thing short of parting with you, I shall submit to,  in order to make your residence with me agreeable." </p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, then, I need expect no relief from misery,"  she replied, "for nothing short of a separation  from you, and restoration to my friends, can afford  such relief. Oh, restore me to them, and I  shall never cease to bless you, I shall never cease  to pray for your happiness!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"What!" said he, "no---no---you know not  how I adore your loveliness, or you would not expect  me to part with it so soon. It would be folly  indeed, to throw that treasure out of my hand,  for which the whole world could not afford me an  equivalent. But the whole world, Miss Frazier,  cannot now deprive me of you. That blessed  consideration makes me ample amends for your  present displeasure. Oh, smile upon one who  doats on you, and be reconciled to yield to the  ardour of his affections, by becoming his wife, and  his whole future conduct, he pledges his salvation,  shall be regulated so as to make you happy."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, recovering her full energy of  manner and tone---"never---never! You have  already had my answer on that subject; an answer  which no earthly consideration can ever induce  me to change. No, my heart would burst  to pieces ere my tongue should utter a promise to  be yours."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Well, my sweet tormentor, you would inflict  a pang into my soul, would you, by such a manifestation  of hatred for me? But, by heavens!  you are beautiful, and so long as I can behold  those fascinating features, I shall feel no pangs of  any kind! When I shall feel sorrow, I shall fly to <pb n="205"/>  you, and gaze upon you. The sight of your  charms will quicken me into joy, and to clasp  them to my enraptured bosom, will transport me  into bliss." He paused---but she continued silent,  shuddering at his vehemence; and he soon  again continued:</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Maiden! You say you will never promise to  be mine. Be it so. I can, if I please, dispense  with that promise, and yet be happy. For know,  my enchantress, you are at this moment mine to all  intents and for all purposes, as completely and absolutely,  as if the priest had made you so. It is  for your own sake, my fair one, and not for mine,  that I wish the forms to be gone through. What  say you?---will you consult your own reputation,  your own purity, and the satisfaction of your  friends, and pronounce the vow which will make  me happy without making you wretched."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Never!"---she replied, in a tone of firmness  and decision---"never. If I am doomed to  wretchedness, no act of my own shall ever be,  with my knowledge, accessary to it. If I cannot  control the power of others over me, I can, at  least, control the meaning of the words that I  utter, and never shall I utter any which will entitle  you to exercise authority over me."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Say you so, obstinate, foolish girl?" he replied,  with considerable irritation. "But your obstinacy,  or if you prefer the phrase, your firmness  on this point, shall be tried. By heavens! if I  did not love you too sincerely to seize your  charms, and rifle your sweets without ceremony,  I would not delay my bliss one hour. But harsh,  inconsiderate as you are, your purity and satisfaction  of mind, are worth something in my estimation;  they are worth at least a few days postponement  of my happiness. It shall be, therefore,  postponed that it may be the sweeter when<pb n="206"/> it comes; for, by the great God, I swear, it shall  come with your own consent, if I should shake  your very soul to its centre in order to extort that  consent from you! This is my determination,  seducing, obdurate girl! I shall now leave you to  reflect upon it. But your lovely hand shall first  impress rapture upon my lips."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he forcibly kissed her hand, and  left the apartment. Maria threw herself upon the  bed, and burst into tears. The full sense of her  wretched situation, and still more wretched prospects,  rushed violently upon her mind, and she  poured forth the sorrows of her soul to her Maker,  from whom alone, if there was any deliverance  for her, could she expect it, by some miraculous  means to proceed. She prayed, fervently  prayed, that whatever might be the acuteness  of her personal sufferings, she should, at least, bear  them without sinning, and that if her distress  should occasion her destruction, her soul should  return to him from whom it had proceeded, as undefiled,  and as unoffending as she had received it.</p>

<p>This pious train of thought had the effect of  greatly tranquillizing her mind, and when, in about  fifteen minutes after the departure of De Villiers,  a squaw entered her apartment with some refreshments,  she prevailed on herself to partake slightly  of them, after which, committing herself to the  all-powerful protection of the God on whom she  relied, she locked her chamber door, and throwing  her harassed frame again upon the couch, endeavoured  to court repose.</p>

<p>But it was long before she obtained it. The  misfortunes of Charles Adderly, who loved her  so tenderly, and to whom the whole affections of  her soul were engaged, for sometime occupied  and agitated her mind, so entirely and intensely,  as almost to obliterate the recollection of her <pb n="207"/> own. The awful fate which she feared he either  had suffered, or would be doomed to suffer, from  the cruelty of the savages, excited her mind, as  she reflected deeply upon it, to a species of intolerable  feeling, so nearly bordering upon despair,  that she could have wished herself annihilated,  to get rid of it. When she pictured to herself  the horrors of his destruction, amidst the  flames, gladly, gladly would she have rejoiced in  the possibility of becoming herself a substitute to  undergo the dreadful doom in his stead.</p>

<p>Then, again, when the terrors of her own situation  would recur to her, the possibility of being  condemned to the horrible embraces of a wretch  whose villany she execrated, occasioned her to  shudder, a cold sweat broke upon her frame, and  she thought that even Charles's worst fate must be  happiness, compared with hers.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, would to my God!" she mentally exclaimed,  "that sooner than permit such a catastrophe  to take place, he would strike me dead  with his thunder, or cause this building to take  fire and consume me amidst the conflagration.</p>
            </quote>

<p>Nature at length became wearied with the  poignancy of sorrow, and she sunk into a kind of  stupor which terminated, at last, in a slumber,  disturbed and troubled, indeed, but infinitely  more refreshing and invigorating in its effects  than she had any reason to expect.</p>

<p>She arose the next morning, rejoiced to find herself  restored to a degree of resolution and fortitude,  of which, the preceding evening, she had  been entirely destitute; and she now felt as if she  could courageously meet her fate, let its aspect  be ever so appalling.</p>

<p>The squaw that had the night before brought  refreshments to her, appeared some time after  she arose, with a request from the Governor that <pb n="208"/> she would favour him with her company at breakfast,  which was waiting for her in a parlour below  stairs. This invitation she declined on the plea  of indisposition. The squaw retired, but in a  short time returned to prepare breakfast in her  apartment, and in a few minutes was followed by  De Villiers himself, who saluted her with great  politeness, hoped her indisposition was not of a  serious nature, and since she was unable to afford  him the pleasure of her presence at breakfast, below,  he would crave the liberty to enjoy it in her  own room.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"You are master here, sir," said she, "and no  doubt, despotically enough disposed to make all  such matters bend to your will. My opposition  to your taking this liberty, would I am therefore  persuaded, be fruitless, and should not relieve me  of your presence, let me feel it as disagreeable as I  may."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Then my presence is still disagreeable to  you," he observed; "well, let it be so, since  yours affords me delight, by the Holy Virgin! I  will enjoy it. But, my fair one, I wish you to join  me in this breakfast, for, by my faith, I did not  bring you here to starve you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," said she, "on condition that you avoid  the subject so grating to my feelings, I shall partake  with you, but on no other."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He bowed a complaisant assent, and she sat  down to table with him. But the meal was scarcely  over when he renewed the ungrateful subject.</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Oh! how happy, Miss Frazier," he said,  looking tenderly at her, and drawing a deep sigh,  "should I be, if you were thus the voluntary and  permanent mistress of my table, and myself! Oh,  will you not consent to receive the hand of the  man who loves you beyond all the world?"</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="209"/>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"The reply, sir," said she, "that I have so  decisively given to that question already, I think  might be sufficient to convince you of the inutility  of repeating it. That reply was made never to be  changed, and it never can be changed!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Other methods must then be tried," said he  with fierceness; "for by heavens! I must have  you for my own, if there be energy in human power  to effect it!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>At this moment the sound of a trumpet was  heard. "It is these cursed Indians," said he,  starting to his feet, "that are going to hold a  council concerning our English prisoners, a number  of whom they are resolved to burn. I have  been trying to persuade them from it, but it won't  do. They must be gratified; otherwise they'll go  off in dudgeon, and I cannot spare them at present,  lest the British under Dunbar should think proper  to make a trip this way. I must attend their counsel  now and save as many lives as I can."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria, whose humanity shuddered at this intelligence,  and who that moment thought upon the  fate of Charles Adderly, which, for aught she knew,  might be dependent upon the decision of this very  council---caught the Governor's arm as he was going  away.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, for the love of heaven! Monsieur de  Villiers," said she, "save these unfortunate men.  God will bless you for the deed."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Since it is your wish, my sweet one," he replied,  "I shall do my utmost; but these savages  claim so much merit for their fighting the day before  yesterday, that I fear I shall make but little  of them, especially as they captured these men  themselves. So eager, Miss Frazier, are they  for burning their prisoners, that I am told a party  of them left the field of battle with one or two  captives whom they were resolved not to be <pb n="210"/> baffled in sacrificing, and carried them southward,  lest, if they had brought them to the garrison, I  should have interfered to save them. But I perceive  the old Mingo prophet, Tonnaleuka, among  them. This promises well, as he is always averse  to burning prisoners, and he has more power over  them than I have. Between us, I think we sball  be able to save some of these Englishmen."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh! I beseech you to save them all, if you  can," cried Maria.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"That is impossible," he returned; "I have already  conceded that they should have at least  twelve at their disposal; they claimed this as a  reward for their conduct in the late battle, and I  could not well refuse them. The present counsel  is to determine how many more they shall have,  as well as to select the twelve for whom they  have already stipulated. If the Mingo prophet  assists me, I think, however, we shall be able to  save the remainder."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"That prophet is a good man," observed Maria;  "I know he will assist you, and may heaven  also assist you in the benevolent work."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Amen," said De Villiers."Good morning,  my sweet girl. I will think of your wishes, and  if possible protect these men."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Shortly after De Villiers departed, the sorrowful  Maria beheld from a window the wretched  captives, nearly forty in number, tied together, in  pairs, and surrounded by several hundred savages  who were dancing, singing, halloing, and exhibiting,  in every grotesque and frantic manner that  could be conceived, their triumph over the unfortunate  objects of their barbarous mirth. Her  heart for a moment rejoiced to see that Charles  Adderly was not among them; but it almost immediately  sunk within her, when she recollected <pb n="211"/> that his destruction was perhaps on that very account,  the more certainly inevitable.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"For he, alas," she sighed, "my unfortunate  Charles! He must be in the hands of those inveterate  savages who fled with their victims lest the  French should rescue them from their barbarity.  Ah! my Charles, to what an evil destiny have we  both been born!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>As these reflections passed through her mind,  she grew dizzy, the surrounding objects wavered  before her eyes, and she staggered back to her  couch; but there a flood of tears coming to her relief,  she soon became again calm and resigned,  and resumed her station at the window. Here  her heart warmed to behold Tonnaleuka. His  presence seemed, even under the circumstances in  which she beheld him, to throw a certain consciousness  of security around her, and an almost confident  hope that the poor captives who excited so  much of her sympathy, would escape uninjured.</p>

<p>He was earnestly talking to some of the Indian  chiefs, who appeared to listen to him with great  attention. At length De Villiers went forward to  him, and walking aside with him to some distance  from the groupe, they seemed to converse together  for about ten minutes with great earnestness. The  Governor then returned to the Indians, and giving  the word to march, a flourish of trumpets succeeded,  and the party, consisting almost altogether  of Indians and prisoners, proceeded out of the fortress.  Tonnaleuka remaining some distance behind,  took an opportunity, after the Governor had  disappeared, when he was unnoticed by the sentinel  who was looking after the procession, to make  an obeisance to Maria, who still remained at the  window. He then lifting his right hand to heaven,  and putting it three times on his right ear, thereby  intimated his assurance, that God would hear her <pb n="212"/> prayers for protection, and afford her deliverance.  She motioned to him in token of understanding  his meaning, and he disappeared, leaving on her  mind a feeling of encouragement, of an indefinable,  but invigorating nature, as strong and cheering  as if it imparted an almost certain conviction  that she was under the immediate care of heaven,  and she felt a degree of tranquillity and fortitude  that she had not before experienced since her captivity.</p>

<p>In about two hours, she heard the trumpets  again sounding, and, in a short time, the captives  and their savage conquerors returned into the fort.  Maria perceived that the procession was not now  so numerous as when it left the fort; but this excited  no surprise in her mind, as the roving and  irregular habits of the Indians occasioned them  often to disappear suddenly and unaccountably  from scenes, in which it might be expected they  would feel the highest interest.</p>

<p>The prisoners being conducted to their quarters,  the Indians dispersed, and the greater  number of them instantly left the fort; and De  Villiers hastened to visit the lovely captive whom  he had immediately under his own custody.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Miss Frazier," said he, as he entered her  apartment; "I am heartily glad to get rid of these  savages, and once more enjoy the delight of your  presence. It is like changing the company of  fiends for that of an angel."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah! sir, tell me," she returned, "Has any  thing been done for the poor Englishmen? Have  you secured their safety?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"They are all safe, thank God!" he replied;  "except the twelve I mentioned to you who have  been selected by lot. I exerted myself greatly,  since I knew it would please you. They have  given up all the others to us as prisoners of war."</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Why I fear much that the savages will burn  them, according to their custom in such cases,"  replied De Villiers.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"And oh, Monsieur de Villiers," said she, "is  there no way left to save them from such a cruel  fate? Have you not force enough, influence  enough, to protect them. Oh, think that these  men may have tender relatives---fathers, and mothers,  wives and children, whose hearts are at this  day in agony to ascertain their fate! Oh, think,  feel, if thou canst feel for the misery of others,  what will be their horror, their distraction, when  they hear that those so dear to them have come  to such a terrible end. Oh, do something to  save them, I conjure, thee if thou wouldst expect  salvation thyself!"</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Why, my sweet enchantress," said he, "why  plead so strongly in behalf of men of whom thou  knowest nothing, and who neither know nor care  any thing about thee; and yet be so indifferent to  the prayers and entreaties of one who adores thee?  Why feel and tremble so much at the idea of mere  strangers being burned to death by a fire of wood,  and show so little compassion for one whose life  thou art barbarously consuming in the flames  kindled by thy own charms? Ah! why, cruel  girl, accuse the savages of barbarity to their  victims, who are their enemies, when thou art thyself  as barbarous, and hard-hearted to thy own  lover---to me, alas! who love you with a passion  too violent for me to bear long unrequited and  live."</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"If you give me your hand at the altar," said  he, after a little apparent meditation, "as the  price of their lives, you shall have them, if I  should turn out my garrison to rescue them from  the stakes."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, heavenly Father!" she exclaimed, "to  what a situation am I reduced! Alas, sir, I cannot,  I cannot---Oh, hear me---I would, ah! I think I  would give it to you to save these victims, but  alas, it is pledged, irrevocably pledged to another."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Your hand pledged to another!" exclaimed  De Villiers, rising from his seat in surprise, and  pacing the room in great irritation. "Your hand  pledged to another, and no doubt your heart too---  Miss Frazier, is it not so!"</p>

Miss Frazier, you will surely not place  such a trifle, such a nonentity into competition  with the lives of twelve human beings.

            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, sir!---Oh, what can I do? but it is impossible.  I cannot unsay what I have said. I  cannot forfeit my truth! No, no, rather than that,  let me first die the death allotted to these men!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Then these men whom you devote to the  flames shall die!" said he, and he hastened out of  the room in a paroxysm of rage.</p>
            </quote>

<p>In about twenty minutes the sound of trumpets  was heard, and a guard of soldiers appeared conducting  twelve prisoners across the court of the  fortress opposite Maria's window, at the distance  of about twenty yards from which De Villiers  gave the word, and the party halted, and fronted  towards the window. The prisoners with their  heads uncovered, then kneeled and looked up to  Maria, as if earnestly supplicating for some important  favour.</p>

<p>De Villiers left them in this situation, and hastened  to her apartment.</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Look," said he, "hard-hearted girl, at those  poor men now under sentence to suffer, within one  hour, the most terrible of all deaths, burning at the  stake! Look at them on their knees imploring  thee to deliver them from a fast approaching and  cruel fate. I have told them that their destiny is  in thy hands, that if it pleaseth thee, I will defend <pb n="216"/> them from the vengeance of the savages, and procure  a reversal of the condemnation that has been  passed against them. Wilt thou save them, or wilt  thou let them perish?"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Maria looked at the men. Their uniforms of  red, in times of prosperity the most brilliant and  imposing of all warlike colours, now stained and  tattered; their wobegone countenances and  wearied-out frames, their humble posture, their  hair uncovered and scattered to the winds,  to the imagination of Maria, bespoke misery,  hardship, and terror in the extreme. She burst  into tears as she beheld them; for she reflected  that these very men, had, perhaps, been once happy  in the enjoyment of domestic comforts, virtuous  endearments, and tender attachments; and  now, when on the very verge of terminating their  existence, of leaving all their joys and affections  behind them, and undergoing the most excruciating  species of destruction, she beheld them imploring  her, who had it in her power to save them by foregoing  her own happiness, not to consign them to  their awful doom from any selfish consultation of  her own wishes, but by gratifying a man who  besought her to become his wife, to deliver them  and restore them to safety. What was she to do?  Could she deny De Villiers, and have these poor  supplicants carried off to instant destruction; or  could she yield to his desires, and make herself  miserable, and, what was the worst of all alternatives,  be unfaithful to Charles Adderly?</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>De Villiers perceived her wavering, and he  urged her to a decision. "Five minutes, my  love," said he, pulling out his watch---"Let five  minutes pass without promising to become my  wife, and these men shall be ordered away to the  stakes and the faggots already prepared for their  execution---"</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="217"/>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, barbarous man! have mercy, have mercy!" she exclaimed. Her eyeballs swelled---her  lips quivered and grew pale, her limbs tottered under  her, and she fell backwards upon the floor. "God of heaven, I have killed her!" cried De Villiers.  He lifted her in his arms, placed her on the  bed, and calling loudly for assistance, the attending  squaw made her appearance. Some stimulants  were applied to Maria's temples, and she soon began  again to respire, and recover her sensibility.  She at length incoherently exclaimed:---</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh! tell me---they have not surely sent them  to the flames! The governor cannot be so barbarous!  Let them be saved---let them be saved!  Alas! I cannot bear to have them burned!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>De Villiers now made a signal out of the window,  for the troops and the prisoners to withdraw.  Then returning to Maria's bed-side, he watched  over her with great anxiety, until he saw the regular  chain of her thoughts properly restored,  which took place much sooner than he expected.  His desire to work upon her feelings, so as to extort  from her a consent to marry him, returned  with her recovery; and to her inquiry of what  had been done with the unfortunate prisoners, he  replied,</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"They are, my love, respited until to-morrow  at noon, in order that you may have time to deliberate  leisurely, and decide upon their fate and  mine. And, oh! may I conjure you, Miss Frazier,  before that time, to resolve on saying the  word, which will save them from destruction, and  me from despair! I shall now leave you, that you  may enjoy repose. Give your commands to Halmanna,  this squaw, and she will supply you with  whatever the garrison can afford to make you <pb n="218"/> comfortable." So saying, he relieved Maria of  his presence by withdrawing from the apartment.</p>
            </quote>

<p>The shock she had sustained had thrown her  into a violent fever; and a certain wildness in her  expression and manner had become so apparent,  as to alarm Halmanna, who in consequence entertained  some thoughts of acquainting De Villiers  with the circumstance, in order that medical  aid might be procured, when she saw the  prophet Tonnaleuka entering the house. Halmanna,  who believed that if either earthly or spiritual  aid could assist Maria, the prophet was the  most likely person to afford it, answered Tonnaleuka's  inquiry after Miss Frazier, by expressing  a desire that he should visit her, as she was very  sick.</p>

<p>This being exactly what Tonnaleuka intended  to do, he did not require a second invitation; but  desiring the squaw to remain below stairs, and  not come near the apartment unless sent for,  while he remained with the young lady, he in a  few moments was in Maria's presence. The very  appearance of this venerable man, who had from  her infancy been her guide, her oracle, and her  friend, and the soothing, parental sound of his  voice, produced a powerful effect in allaying her  fever, which, having been occasioned altogether  by an over-wrought mental excitement, now obtained  its proper remedy in the application of  comfort, encouragement, and consolation.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, my father," said she, as he advanced,  "your Maria has at length known misfortune---  she has suffered misery, she has felt despair---Oh,  art thou now come, as thou wert ever wont, to  administer peace and comfort to my soul?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, I am come for that purpose," <pb n="219"/> replied the prophet, sitting down beside her, "and  I thank our Great Father, it is in my power."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, hear me! my words are comfort,  and they are truth. Thou hast this day been  greatly imposed upon by the wicked governor of  this fortress! The prisoners whom thou sawest,  are not condemned to suffer, nor are there any  now under such condemnation. Alas! those who  were condemned---twelve gallant soldiers, my  heart still bleeds for them---were meanly given up  by the Governor ere I could interpose in their  behalf, and in despite of all my exertions, they  were carried across the Alleghany river at noon  this day, and committed to the flames. Their  sufferings are by this time terminated, and the  tribes will, on this occasion, require no more victims."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Hear me, my daughter. Those who were  sentenced to die, returned not back to the fort after  leaving it this morning. A band of Ottawas  went directly with them to the place of death,  and many of my red brothers who did return to  the fort, followed immediately after dismissal, to  view the sacrifice."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Hear me farther. As I was amidst the English  prisoners, after the Indians had withdrawn,  assuring them of their safety, for they understood  not the language in which their fate was  decided, and therefore knew it not, the Governor  came among them. He ordered twelve of  them to be separated from the rest. He promised  them permission to return to their countrymen  under colonel Dunbar, if they would advance  into the middle of the fortress-yard, and  there kneel, uncovered, before a young lady who  should appear at the window of his residence,  and obtain in that humble posture, her consent to  their enlargement. He informed them, that while <pb n="220"/> making their supplications, they should not speak,  as the lady did not understand English; (for his  whole scheme was a system of falsehood,) but  that he himself should convey to her the purport  of their request, and report the lady's answer.  He has since informed them that your answer  will not be given till to-morrow noon. In the  meantime, the men are duped by his artifice to  expect liberty which he will not grant, as you  have been deceived into the belief that they were  petitioning to be rescued from a danger which  they neither dreaded, nor have any reason to  dread."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Therefore, my daughter, hear my advice.  Persevere in your refusal to become this man's  wife. Powerful as he is, the Great Spirit is  more powerful than he, and will frustrate all  his designs against you, because he loves virtue,  and you are virtuous, and because he hates vice,  and this man is vicious. Before many days, I  trust that the Great Spirit will raise up a deliverer  for you, and disappoint the tyrant in his designs."</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Father, you have indeed comforted me," she replied. "You have restored life to my soul.  For myself, I now fear nothing, since thou, whose  words have never yet deceived me, hast bade me  not fear. But, Oh, father! forgive my weakness,  when I say I am still wretched, since there  is one whom thou knowest to be dear to me, in  danger. Alas! I need not name him. Canst  thou tell me aught of him?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter," said the prophet, "I know  thy heart is distressed on account of that youth.  I have discovered the path his captors have <pb n="221"/>  caused him to tread, and hope too, that the Great  Spirit will extend to him a share of that mercy  with which he is ever ready to aid the virtuous  and that he will rescue him whose misfortunes  you lament, from the dangers that surround him."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, I again recommend you to be  of good cheer in all these matters. Inform not  the Governor that you know his perfidy. It would  only exasperate him, and induce him to have recourse  to other stratagems which might involve  you in fresh troubles. Require time to deliberate,  ere you give an answer to his demands. A  little delay may bring you deliverance. But never,  never, on any account, answer him according to  his wishes. For, my daughter, you know him  to be wicked. Uniting your fate with him, would  be, therefore, to join in his wickedness. But I need  not counsel you thus, since I know that your virtue  is firm, and your heart constant."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, father," said she, seizing the prophet's  hand and kissing it, while she moistened it with  tears of gratitude and joy, "thou hast ever  been to me the source of wisdom and the inspirer  of virtue. Next to my heavenly Preserver,  I owe to thee the chief blessings of my life.  Whilst thou watchest over my safety, methinks  that no evil can befal me. Oh, father, wilt thou  watch over that of Charles Adderly? Alas, what  would protection be to me if he meets with destruction!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My daughter, hear me---all that is in my power  to do for that young man, is now doing; and when  I say I doubt not of his safety, why should you  doubt of it? Why should you tremble, when I say to  you, be of good cheer on his account as well as  your own? Our great Father, on whom you  must never forget to place your principal dependence,  will never fail you.

            </quote>

<p>He now departed---but before leaving the house,  he laid upon Halmanna his commands that she  should inform no one of his visit to the sick lady.</p>

<p>In about half an hour after the prophet withdrew,  De Villiers visited Maria. He expressed  great satisfaction to find that she was so much  better than he had expected; but as she felt an  inclination for repose, and informed him of it, he  conceived that indulging her in it at this time,  would contribute greatly to the further restoration  of her health and serenity. He therefore,  shortened his visit, and briefly exhorting her for  the sake of the unhappy prisoners, as he called  them, for his sake, and for her own, before the  appointed hour, to determine on being his wife,  he withdrew without offering her any species of  rudeness.</p>

<p>The next morning, wishing to gain somewhat  upon her esteem, by a conciliating demeanor, and  a show of delicacy towards her, he admitted her  plea of indisposition, and did not insist on joining  her at breakfast. Shortly afterwards, however,  he entered her apartment. She appeared  tranquil and resigned, because the suggestion of  hope had afforded her consolation, and inspired  her with fortitude. There was, in consequence,  a sweetness in her looks, and an increase of her  charms, unknown or unthought of by herself, <pb n="224"/> which rendered her appearance altogether more  irresistibly fascinating than he thought he had  ever before beheld it. His passion for her was  therefore more than usually inflamed. But afraid  of again occasioning her such a degree of mental  excitement as had overpowered her the preceding  evening, he resolved to restrain the impetuosity  of his feelings, and, if possible, address  her in language that should neither alarm nor offend  her.</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Miss Frazier," said he, "I need scarcely express  my happiness at seeing your serenity and  contentment so far restored while under my roof,  that I think you could in time bring yourself to  live comfortably with me. This circumstance affords  me some hope that my application for your  hand may not be altogether in vain, and that perhaps  you have come to the resolution to decide  favourably upon the important affair now committed  to your award."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," she replied, "I have been thinking of  that affair; but it is really one of too much importance  to be decided without more deliberation  than I have yet given it."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Ah! Miss Frazier!" said he, "surely you  cannot hesitate to interpose a single word between  twelve fellow-beings and destruction; and you  know the hour speedily approaches, which, without  that interposition, shall consign them to their  fate."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Monsieur De Villiers," said she, "I have never  yet asked a favour from you for myself,  and when I first entered these walls I conceived  that I never should. I have now changed my  mind so far as to make a request, which I hope  you will not refuse to grant."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"Ask it! my sweet one," he replied, "and any  thing but parting with you, that is within the <pb n="225"/> compass of my power to grant, I pledge my honour  shall not be denied you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"My request is moderate," she replied, "altogether  within your power to grant. It is only that  I may be indulged with a few days longer time to  deliberate on this matter; for I feel it impossible to  bring my mind to such an instantaneous change  of feeling, as to forget the youth to whom I am  pledged, and promise to wed another, by the mere  effort of only one day's consideration."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He paced the room for some time in silent meditation  after hearing this request. At length, he  said,</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"It is perhaps reasonable; it is perhaps natural,  that this should be so; and you will never find  me, my bewitching girl, inclined to treat you unreasonably.  You shall have a few days; but, oh!  let them be few---for my heart longs, exceedingly  longs, to call you its own!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Give me one week," said she; "alas! I fear  even that will be too short for my purpose!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"My fairest love!" cried he, "must I postpone  my bliss so long? But I will indulge  thee. I will show thee by so doing, that I value  thy comfort, thy wishes, more than I do my own.  I will now hasten to inform the unfortunate Englishmen  that they have obtained from thee at least  one week's reprieve from their awful sentence:  and oh! may they at last obtain from thy humanity  their final deliverance! Think not that I am  cruel towards them, my fair one. Alas! thou  art cruel towards me; and if they be sacrificed,  it shall be to thy barbarity---they shall be the  victims of my rejected love."</p>
            </quote>

<p>She made no reply to this hypocritical address;  for her soul despised his deception, and she even  feared to look at him, lest the indignation of her  eyes should betray that she was aware of his <pb n="226"/> falsehood. Very much to her satisfaction, however,  he scarcely waited for a reply, but, with the  self-congratulating air of a man who has gained a  great triumph, he bade her good morning, and retired.</p>

<p>The next day happened to be a gala day among  the French, whether on account of its being the  birth-day of a saint or a <emph>grand monarque</emph>, is immaterial,  and arrangements had been made for celebrating  it by a grand fete, in which the greater  portion of the soldiers were to be engaged. About  two hundred and fifty, it was resolved, should proceed  about mid-day to a rising ground, now called  Grant's Hill, nearly half a mile to the eastward  of the fort, where it was intended that they  should march, and countermarch, fire artillery  and musketry, eat a hearty dinner, and get  drunk, and sing, and swear, and dance, and cut  capers, until they were tired; when they should  return in the evening to the fort, tumble into their  couches, and snore off their debauch like gay  fellows.</p>

<p>At about twelve o'clock, the whole garrison was  accordingly put in motion, the soldiers and officers  running promiscuously to and fro upon the parade  ground, where they were to fall into ranks, previous  to their marching for the scene of revelry.</p>

<p>Maria had just stationed herself at her window,  to view the scene, when she beheld the Tonnaleuka  entering the fortress-gate, accompanied by an  Indian chief, of a tall and majestic figure. De  Villiers had, at this moment, entered upon the parade-ground,  for the purpose of ordering the troops  to assume their ranks. He halted as he perceived  the prophet and the chief advancing towards him.  After conversing a few minutes with the former,  he made an obeisance to the latter; and calling  upon a soldier, he gave him some instructions, <pb n="227"/> when the soldier led the way, followed by Tonnaleuka  and his companion, to the governor's house.  In a short time, the soldier returned to take his  place in the ranks; and in less than fifteen minutes  more, the drums and fifes struck up a quick  march, and the whole party proceeded to Grant's  Hill. Soon afterwards, Maria perceived the prophet  alone crossing the area before her window,  towards the gate. He looked suddenly back, at a  time when he was unnoticed by any one in the  yard, and hastily saluting her, continued his way  out of the fort.</p>

<p>There was an air of something of importance  and satisfaction visible in his manner. She even  thought, that, at the time he saluted her, she had  seen, what she did not recollect ever before to  have seen, a smile playing on his countenance, and  she could not but feel confident that some event  was about to take place for her advantage.</p>

<p>She was occupied with these thoughts, when  Halmanna, entering the room, informed her that  she had been commanded by the Mingo prophet  to conduct a chief of the Piantia tribe into her  apartment, but not to reveal the circumstance to  any other person in the garrison.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"What can this chief want with me?" thought  Maria. "But he can want nothing but good, since  his errand is sanctioned by Tonnaleuka." She  therefore desired Halmanna to admit him. Her  heart beat violently as she heard his steps advancing.  She rose to meet him, and beckoned the  squaw, who was entering before him, to retire.  He was dressed in an elk-skin robe, the long skirts  of which reached below the calves of his legs.  This robe was closely wrapped round his waist, so  as to show the well-formed configuration of his  person, and fastened securely there with a broad <pb n="228"/> belt, fantastically, but rather handsomely, ornamented  with porcupine's quills dyed of various  colours. His arms were covered with a kind of  roller, made of stripes of the soft fur-skins of the  smaller animals, neatly enough attached to each  other with thongs of half-tanned deer-skin, and  wound round the arms from the shoulders to the  wrists. At the shoulders, the elbows, and the  wrists, these rollers were kept in their places by  leathern bands, also ornamented with variegated  porcupine's quills. His cap was of a very  showy description, made of beaver-skin, with a  high plume formed of feathers of different dyes,  which, glittering in the sun as he moved along the  fortress-yard, produced to the eye of the spectator  a very striking and brilliant effect. Tassels, made  of small feathers, also of various colours, hung in  abundance, eight or nine being on each side, over  his ears and down his cheeks, so as to shade and  partly conceal them; forming, on the whole, a singularly  beautiful and gaudy costume. His feet  and legs were covered with mockasins and leggins,  in the usual manner of the Indians.</p>

<p>This chief, so majestic in his person and splendid  in his apparel, on entering the chamber of Maria,  approached her evidently with much emotion,  and, to her great astonishment, addressed  her in English.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"How sorry I am, Miss Frazier," said he, "to  find you a captive in such a place, and in the hands  of such a man!---But I forget---you do not know  me in this disguise. Alas! has the form of him  who loves you with an ardour beyond whatever  man has felt for woman, made so slight an impression  upon your mind, that the mere changing of  the hue of his countenance can conceal him from  your recollection? Must I name to you the man  who loves you with a tenderness and a <pb n="229"/>  devotedness, which none but himself can ever feel?---  alas, must I name to you---George Washington?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh, my friend!" cried she, alarmed for his  safety---"friend of the oppressed! hero of thy  country! how is it that you have ventured upon  this dangerous ground? I tremble lest you be discovered.  The Indians would have no mercy upon  you, and the French who possess this place are  scarcely less barbarous."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"To rescue you, my soul's beloved," he replied,  "I did not hesitate to venture here. Ah,  where would I not venture for such a purpose!  But, fear not, Miss Frazier, I come strong in the  confidence of doing a good deed; strong in the  confidence that he who has preserved me amidst  more eminent dangers, will preserve me through  this; or if I should fall doing my duty, and in the  attempt to serve thee, thou fairest, most injured of  my country's daughters, it shall be a fall so honest,  so glorious, that my conscious spirit will in  other regions look back upon it as a matter of joy  and exultation."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah, sir!" said she; "was it not rash to risk  that life on which, perhaps, the salvation of a  nation depends, for the safety of an individual!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"It is never rash to perform our duty," replied  the hero; "no matter what may be the risk.---  Thou wert in distress. I was informed of it. That  information was a call from heaven to hasten to  thy rescue, and I fear not but that heaven will assist  me in accomplishing it."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Yes," said she; "I have confidence in your  success, although I know not by what means you  intend to effect it. But you are the favourite of  heaven, and whatever you may undertake I know  will succeed. But were you not afar off when I  was seized? It is yet but a few days since. By <pb n="230"/> what strange means could you hear it, and by what  miracle are you here, in the midst of the terrors of  fort Du Quesne so soon, and uninjured?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I shall inform you," said he. "It was the  evening before yesterday. I had just returned  from the procession which conveyed General  Braddock to his last home, when your brother  Paddy entered my tent. He acquainted me in a  few words, but they were words that cut me to  the heart, that the French had attacked your father's  house, and carried you off to Fort Du  Quesne, by order of its Governor. Alas, thought  I, now indeed is come to pass that which I long  feared would be the consequence of so much  beauty living so far from the protection of the  laws and customs of regular society! But it was  no time for retrospection. How to rescue you  from your ravishers was the only question. To  think of force was vain. The remnant of the  Virginians left by the late battle, scarcely exceed  a hundred, and Dunbar is commander of the regulars.  But even had I possessed an adequate  force with which to attack this fortress, to bring  that force against it, would not have been the surest  way to effect your deliverance. It would  have warned the tyrant that he was in danger of  losing you, and he would have removed you to  some secret place, where perhaps all our diligence  could not have found you. Personal exertions  were, therefore, the only means I had left, and I  resolved to try them. The prophet had desired  me to meet him in his cavern, with as little delay  as possible, in order to decide upon the measures  we should adopt. Before coming to any determination,  therefore, I thought proper to hasten  there."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I accordingly informed Colonel Dunbar, who,  on account of the harassed and fatigued state of <pb n="231"/> his men, does not intend to leave his present station  for several days, of my intended absence; and  furnishing Paddy with a horse, he led the way  with great rapidity, and we arrived at the prophet's  concealment last night. I at once approved of  the plan he had formed, and as he had already  provided all that we conceived necessary for its  execution, we set out from his cavern about two  hours since, and thank Providence, have thus far  succeeded. The rest remains for the night to  accomplish. All that I require of you is, that  you will be courageous and firm in the part you  will have to act. Tonnaleuka provided a disguise  for you as well as for me, and as soon as the  people of the garrison have gone to rest, if we  can only make our way out of the fort, he will  be in waiting at no great distance, with horses  ready to carry us to safety. This is the dress  you are to assume." Here he produced, from under  his robe, the habiliments of a squaw.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"These," he continued, "when the proper time  arrives, you will throw over your other clothes, and  thus concealed, you will act as my interpreter  with the sentinel, and solicit his permission for me  to pass out of the fort to worship, according to the  custom of the Piantia chiefs, beneath a red-oak  tree, to which you are to guide me."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas!" said she, "if the sentinel refuses, we  shall be detected, and then---oh, sir, your destruction  will be inevitable. It is better not to attempt  it---it is, indeed too dangerous. Why should you  suffer along with me? Let me bear my own misfortunes  alone! It would only double their weight  upon my head, if your generosity should involve  you in them."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Fear nothing, dearest Maria!" returned Washington;  "if the sentinel should refuse, I shall have  a remedy at hand. We need not now trouble <pb n="232"/> ourselves with the fear of such a difficulty, for I  assure you, that if we overcome all others, we  shall overcome that also."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah! I perceive," she exclaimed, "that there  are indeed, other difficulties of a perilous nature.  The Governor may come and discover you here,  and you will be undone."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"He knows me only," said Washington, "as the  character I now personate---a chief of the Piantia  tribe, come here by order of his nation, to form a  treaty of alliance with the French. Tonnaleuka  is my interpreter, and the Governor has agreed to  give us an audience to-morrow morning after  breakfast. In the mean time he has given directions  that I shall be entertained in this house with  all proper respect. The squaw Halmanna has  received her particular instructions from the prophet,  which you are aware, she will not be easily  induced to disobey."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"As to the governor finding me here: he will,  you may be assured, return with too much bustle  and noise from the revels, to take me by surprise;  and I can easily resume the apartment that has  been allotted to me, before he advances to the  house. So, on the whole, Miss Frazier, I do not  see that I stand in much danger of being detected." </p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I trust in God that you will not be detected,"  she observed, "and, I believe, the matter is prudently  arranged. I shall endeavour to do all in  my power to promote its success; for, alas, upon  its success alone does my deliverance from a horrible  destiny depend."</p>
            </quote>

<p>To lull suspicion as much as possible, and also  with the view of making himself acquainted with  the different parts of the fortification, so as to be  serviceable to any expedition he might hereafter  accompany against it, he walked, during the <pb n="233"/>  afternoon, openly and freely round the yards and  houses, minutely inspecting the whole circumvallation,  the trench, the different redoubts, and whatever  added to the strength of a place which had  now excited a high degree of terror throughout  all the middle provincess of British America.</p>

<p>Towards the evening, the revellers on Grant's  Hill, returned to the fort, as Washington had foreseen,  with much noise and obstreperous mirth, the  greater number of them being almost overcome  with intoxication. On their approach, Washington  retired to his apartment, where he anxiously  awaited the hour when he might again visit his  beloved, and conduct her to safety.</p>

<p>De Villiers entered her apartment as soon as  he had dismissed the soldiers. His spirits were  under considerable excitement from the wine and  the jollity he had been just enjoying, and when he  beheld Maria more than usually cheerful and  charming, he felt a strong propensity to break  through the agreement he had made with her, and  to delay no longer that bliss for which he so ardently  longed. Her manner, however, more dignified,  calm, and collected, than he had seen it  since she entered the fort, convinced him, for he  was not so intoxicated as to be totally incapable  of reflection, that this could not be accomplished  but by the absolute application of perhaps more  than even his own personal force; and he could  not but recollect, inflamed as he was with both  love and wine, that the perpetration of the deed  in such a manner, would render him detestably  loathsome to her for ever after, and might also be  the means of her instant destruction.</p>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>After entering the room, and saluting her, he  sat gazing at her for several minutes in silence,  absorbed in reflections of this nature. At length,  resolving to restrain his impetuosity, he muttered <pb n="234"/> to himself, but unconsciously in an audible tone, "No, by heavens! I shall not be guilty of such  folly. If I have patience, I shall have her on  more easy and agreeable terms." Then, recollecting  that she must have heard him,--- "Bewitching  being! you have set me mad; you have  rendered me wild!" cried he aloud---"by the sorcery  of your charms!---Ah, by heavens, you know  not the sacrifice I make in delaying my bliss!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>Here the blood gushed to his face, his eyes became  inflamed, and darted the very fire of passion.  "Hell and fiends!" he exclaimed: "If I  must bear this torment longer, it cannot be in the  overpowering presence of her beauties!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he rushed out of the room, to the  great relief of Maria, who trembled in every limb,  as she witnessed the terrifying fury of his lawless  and wicked passions, which had thus gained such  fearful ascendancy over both his reason and his  will.</p>

<p>The governor hastened into his own sittingroom,  and sent for one or two of his officers, with  whom he resolved to become dead drunk, in order  to bury in the gulf of inebriation, the remembrance  of Maria's charms, and the ungratified tortures  of passion which they excited.</p>

<p>Washington's apartment adjoined that in which  these Frenchmen now quaffed their wine in quartfuls,  and roared out their brutish and clamorous  joviality in singing and swearing, until the whole  house rung with the noise. At length, although  at a pretty late hour, he had the satisfaction to  perceive, by their clamour gradually becoming  more feeble and interrupted, that the potent offspring  of the grape was laying his heaviest hand  upon them, and would soon suspend their faculties  altogether. A short time, indeed, <pb n="235"/> accomplished this matter. A dead stillness succeeded  the riotous and unbounded noise that had so lately  filled this region of debauchery, and Washington  justly concluded that the revellers had sunk into  stupor and insensibility upon the scene of their  enjoyment. And although he conceived that the  circumstance was favourable for the enterprise he  had on hand, yet he could not but feel a pang of  mortification and sorrow, when he reflected on the  degradation and debasement of human nature  which this scene presented to his imagination.</p>

     </lg>

<p>It was nearly twelve o'clock---every thing in  the Governor's house was still and silent; even  the squaw had retired to rest, and, excepting those  of Washington and Maria, it is probable that there  was not at that moment a wakeful eye under its  roof.</p>

<p>Washington stole cautiously out of doors, in order  to view the state of matters in other parts of  the garrison. All was as motionless and silent as  his heart could wish. The measured tramp of the  sentinel at the fortress gate, was alone to be heard;  and, although it was in the middle of July, the  clouds of night seemed to perform their office with  much effect, and the face of nature was enveloped  in a tolerably thick mantle of darkness.</p>

<p>Having ascertained this favourable situation of  things, the young hero bent his soul to the business  for which he had thus ventured into the strong  hold of his enemies. He ascended to the chamber  of Maria. He found her waiting with impatience  for his appearance.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Miss Frazier," said he, "thank heaven, the  moment is favourable. Haste, lovely maiden, <pb n="237"/> throw on your disguise. Be of good courage, and  let us proceed from this abode of wickedness and  brutality---God will open the way for us."</p>
            </quote>

<p>A minute or two sufficed to make her ready.  She caught Washington's arm. They descended  the stairs slowly and without noise, and boldly  walked across the area towards the gate.</p>

<quote rend="Sentinel"><p>"Hallo! who comes there?" shouted the sentinel.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"You are my interpreter, remember," whispered  Washington to Maria, "as I do not speak  French."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"We are friends," replied Maria to the sentinel,  imitating, as well as she could, the pronunciation  and tone of a squaw.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Sentinel"><p>"And where are you going, my friends," asked  the soldier, "at this hour? Why does your  comrade remain dumb, mistress?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"This is the Indian chief," she replied, "that  came here to-day with the Mingo prophet. He  cannot speak your language, and on that account  requested me to solicit your permission for him  to pass out to worship the Great Spirit beneath  the branches of the red oak, as all the chiefs  of his nation have been accustomed to do at this  hour of the night, twice every moon, once in the  full, and once in the wane."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Sentinel"><p>"And pray, Mrs. Squaw, what is your business  with this chief? Let him go and worship till he  rots, if he pleases; but for you, my dame, I would  advise you rather to go to sleep. He can worship  devoutly enough without your help, I dare say.  Turn back, mistress, if you please." Here the  sentinel pushed her somewhat back from him,  while she replied, in considerable fright---</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah, sir, my good soldier! I must indeed go  with this chief. He is a stranger, and does not <pb n="238"/> know where to find a red oak tree---I must guide  him."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Sentinel"><p>"Let him take the first tree he meets," said the  sentinel; "it will answer the same purpose, whether  it be oak or hiccory. But as for you, dame  square-toes, I say you shall not pass here to-night.  No, by St. Peter! I shan't risk disobeying orders  so far."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," observed Maria, her agitation having so  much increased that she forgot her assumed character  of the squaw, and to the surprise of the  soldier, spoke good French---"Sir," said she,  "this chief declares that he will not go without  me. Oh! pray, do now, my good friend, permit  us both to pass, and heaven will bless you!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Sentinel"><p>"Heh! who are you?" cried the sentinel. "I  protest you seem somewhat too christianized for a  squaw. By the holy mother! but I believe there  is something wrong in this affair. The Governor  has a lady in keeping. I think I must keep you  both within the walls, till we see who you are. I'll  be broiled, if it would not cost me a bullet in my  heart, if I allowed that lady to escape. Back to  your quarters this moment, or by the devil! I shall  call the guard."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas!" said the frightened Maria in English  to Washington, while the sentinel was uttering this  tirade; "we are discovered, we are ruined! Ah  me! he threatens to call the guard upon us!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>At that instant the sentinel seized Maria rudely  by the arm, and endeavoured to separate her from  the chief, calling out loudly for the assistance of  the guard; but the next instant he fell, with a dagger  plunged to the hilt, by the whole of Washington's  tremendous force, in his heart.</p>

<p>The hero seized the trembling Maria in his  arms, for terror had rendered her unable to support  herself, and hastening with his beloved <pb n="239"/> burden out of the fort, to the spot where Tonnaleuka,  attended by Paddy Frazier, had appointed to wait  with horses, Maria was in a moment placed on one  of them, and her strength being sufficiently recovered,  Tonnaleuka led the way through the woods;  she followed, and Washington and Paddy brought  up the rear.</p>

<p>The numerous shots that they heard fired from  different directions round the fort, soon told them,  as they rode securely through the intricacies of the  forest, that the garrison was alarmed, and that the  next day there would in all probability be a hot  pursuit made after the sweet fugitive who had thus  escaped from the fangs of a tyrant.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half brought them to Tonnaleuka's  cavern, from whence Paddy removed  the horses to a close dingle at some distance, for  the sake of pasturage and concealment.</p>

<p>Some slight refreshment, and the consciousness  of security from the power of the tyrant who had  threatened the ruin of her happiness, together with  the relief from desponding reflections, which the  hurry and excitement of her flight had produced,  now restored Maria to a train of pleasing and  grateful ideas, and she could not refrain from expressing  her sense of the happiness she felt in being  thus once more under the protection of true  friends, and of the obligations she was under to the  brave youth, whose prudence and heroism alone  could have, with the blessing of Providence, effected  her deliverance.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah! Colonel Washington," said she, "to you  I owe more, more obligation and gratitude than I  can express."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Miss Frazier," he replied, "to the Almighty  I owe thanks that he has made me the humble instrument  of preserving the loveliest of his creatures  from wretchedness. I owe these thanks for <pb n="240"/> this never-to-be-forgotten blessing, even on my  own account; for, alas! had that son of barbarity  succeeded in his designs against you---never, never  from that day should I have known comfort in  this world. Miss Frazier, I have told you often  with what ardour and sincerity I love you, how  much my happiness in life depends upon a union  with you; and although you have not thought proper  to encourage my passion, by affording me one  single whisper in its approval, yet I have persisted  to love you, and even to look forward with a fond  hope to the day when you might be brought to  afford me some return of affection, and perhaps  receive me as the happy partner of your fate."</p>
            </quote>

<p>He here paused for a moment. His heart was  full; but Maria appearing too much affected to  reply, he soon resumed---</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Ah, think, beloved of my soul! how much  your present situation requires a protector---how  absolutely it is necessary that you should leave  this lawless Wilderness, where men of untamed and  licentious passions rule every thing according to  their wicked fancies and caprices, unrestrained by  either the laws or the opinions of civilized society.  For your own sake,---for you are now become the  mark against whom the violence of their ruffian  passions will be directed---for the sake of that angelic  purity which is here exposed to the attacks of  fiends---for the sake of your own happiness, the  ruin of which is pursued with barbarous avidity by  the tyrant of these wilds,---fly with me to the protection  of society and laws. Give me---me, who  will otherwise never enjoy this world with satisfaction,  the right to become your protector, and to secure  you an asylum where none will dare to molest  you, and where the friends you love may  also live in security and comfort."</p>

<pb n="241"/>
 
<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"My brave, my generous protector!" cried she,  "how can I answer you! Would to God that I  could recompense your kindness, that I could show  my gratitude, that I could prove to you how much  I esteem your virtues, and admire your nobleness  and heroism of character, by any other means than  that which you ask! But, alas, my most valued,  my most admired friend, you ask what it is not in  my power to give---what is not mine to give"---  she here checked herself for a moment, and then  resumed---"yes; I will intrust thee with the secret  of my heart. I owe thee this---ah, what do I not  owe thee!---but my confidence thou shalt have.  Perhaps I have withheld it too long, and thereby  encouraged thee to entertain hopes which, sorry,  sorry am I to say, must end in disappointment---  my heart, sir, is another's."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Another's!" exclaimed Washington, staggering  back, and for a moment turning pale; but soon  the violence of the shock, severe as it was, yielded  to the native energy of his heroic soul; a moment's  struggle took place, and he recovered his composure,  although not his ease, of mind.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"I am to blame, sir," she continued, "for not  revealing this to you sooner; but, alas, I was too  timid, or rather I was ungenerous enough to fear  the effects of a rivalship between you and the youth  who had gained my affections before I saw you,  for, believe me, that, even when you first sought  my heart, it was not mine to give you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Then, Maria," said Washington with great  calmness, "I know my fate---it is to linger out a  life in this world, as long as Providence may  please to continue it here, without seeking, without  hoping, without caring for personal happiness.  But I am resigned. It is the will of Providence.  My soul, I know, shall never sink under any calamity,  since it does not now sink under this, which <pb n="242"/> is the severest I can ever experience. But, Miss  Frazier, although I can submit without murmuring  either at you, or at Providence, to this forlornness  of my own fate; although I can submit to part  with those blissful hopes which for more than  eighteen months have formed the great solace of my  life, the hopes of you and happiness---yet your welfare,  believe me, is as great an object of solicitude  with me as ever. I therefore again repeat an offer  I once before made to you, that you, and all your  friends---and it must be remembered that from this  date your friends will be no longer safe in this  neighbourhood---should remove to Virginia, where  I shall engage to settle them in comfort, safety,  and respectability."</p>
            </quote>

<p>She was about to reply, when the sound of footsteps  hastily advancing along the dark passage of  the cavern, arrested their attention. In a moment  Doctor Killbreath appeared, and without ceremony  addressed Tonnaleuka:</p>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Your petition has been granted, father; but it  only prolongs Captain Adderly's life till Monday  at noon."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Alas, what of Captain Adderly!" exclaimed  Maria, "where is he? oh, tell me---tell me! for  heaven's sake what is to become of my Charles!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"At the prophet's request," replied the doctor  inconsiderately, "he has been respited from the  flames till Monday; but then I fear that his death  will be inevitable. The Indians, with great reluctance,  granted him this reprieve. The faggots are  already---"</p>
            </quote>

<p>But he said no more, for that moment Maria  fell lifeless to the floor. Washington flew to her  and lifted her in his arms. She breathed not; she  was deadly pale, and the only sign of animation  she displayed was a slight quivering motion observable  in her lips---those lips that had lately been <pb n="243"/> of the most inviting ruby hue, and that countenance  on which every female charm had delighted  to dwell, were now destitute of their graces, and  ghastly, as if the spirit which had imparted their  loveliness, had indeed fled from its possessor, and  left her numbered with the dead. Washington  carried her to a bed to which the agitated Tonnaleuka  conducted him. The soul of the hero, as he  bent over her, and beheld the hand of death thus  apparently upon her, felt the most acute pang of  sorrow he was ever doomed to experience, and  moistened her livid cheeks with the last tears that  were ever seen to fall from his eyes.</p>

<p>The most judicious means within reach were  applied for her recovery, and in about seven or  eight minutes the organs of vitality began to resume  the performance of their functions. She gave  a deep sigh, and respiration recommenced; the  fluid of life again circulated through her veins,  and the beautiful hue of her countenance began to  return.</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Thank my God!" cried Washington, who  first perceived these indications of her restoration,  "thank my God, she will yet live!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Thank thee, thank thee, oh, Great Spirit of  the universe!" said Tonnaleuka, who had been  extremely distressed during the whole scene, "Oh,  thou who restorest this suffering child to us, do  thou support her under the trials thou hast brought  upon her! If the youth of her choice must die  this awful death, do thou enable her to bear the  shock." </p>
            </quote>

<p>She was now able to articulate, but it was in a  manner wild and incoherent. The returning tide  of life brought along with it a burning fever, and  when she spoke, she spoke only in delirium.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Charles Adderly!" were the first sounds she  uttered. "Oh, the savages!" she continued, <pb n="244"/> "they have consumed my love! Take me! take  me! burn me with him! Ah, I feel myself in  flames! my heart is already burning! I am glad  of it! Charles, my beloved, our sorrows will soon  end!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here she relapsed into silence, and appeared  to be again falling into a state of insensibility.  This, however, continued but a few moments, when  her frenzy returned with as much violence as before.</p>

<p>Doctor Killbreath now judiciously proposed to  extract some blood from her arm, which was soon  accomplished, and shortly afterwards she became  tranquil, her horror-struck imagination became  less tortured, and reason, piety, and resignation,  resumed their seat in her soul."</p>

<p>The reader will recollect that in the account  we gave of the battle of Braddock's Field, we  mentioned that Charles Adderly slew a savage  when in the act of levelling his rifle at Washington  at the distance of only a few feet from that  officer, by which means the intended deadly aim  failed to accomplish its purpose. This savage  happened to be a hero of great repute among the  Caughnewago Indians. Several of them perceiving  his fall, gave a howl of lamentation, and instantly  resolved to seize his destroyer, in order to  devote him to the flames, as a sacrifice to the memory  of their slaughtered hero. They accordingly  succeeded in making him prisoner; the attention  of the British being at that time principally  occupied in preserving Braddock from falling into  their hands.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, the Caughnewago  chiefs after a short consultation among themselves  concerning what should be done with Charles and  another prisoner, a Virginian named Bartley, who  had also killed a chief, and whom they were also  resolved to sacrifice, determined to remove them  while yet in their power, to a distance from fort <pb n="247"/> Du Quesne, lest the French might claim them in  the European manner as prisoners of war, and disappoint  them of their revenge.</p>

<p>Twenty warriors, therefore, set off as soon as  a favourable opportunity offered with these prisoners  across the river, and procceeded towards  the head waters of Chartier's Creek, where they intended  to hold a council, in order to condemn  their victims to the flames in the regular manner.  During the march the prisoners were stripped almost  naked, their hands were tied behind them,  and they were subjected to various kinds of barbarous  treatment. They were sometimes whipped  forward with rods, and at other times goaded  with sharp pointed sticks, till the blood trickled  down their sides and backs; while their tormentors  endeavoured, by every species of wild and  frantic exultation, to mortify their feelings with an  acute sense of their degraded and wretched situation.</p>

<p>They halted for the night, upon the margin of a  small stream about ten miles from the field of battle.  Here having tied Charles and his fellow-prisoner,  back to back, they continued to dance  round them in triumph, singing songs of victory,  and clamoring forth yells of exultation for upwards  of an hour. They then feasted upon a deer they  had killed, a large slice of which they threw upon  the grass to each of the captives, but the minds  of the latter were too much overpowered with a  sense of their horrible situation to permit them to  partake of nourishment.</p>

<p>During this awful night, what did Charles Adderly  not suffer both in mind and body? With a  lacerated frame lying, nearly naked, stretched  upon the ground in the open air, with his back  closely bound to that of an unfortunate being in  the same melancholy condition, he suffered a <pb n="248"/> degree of pain, which, notwithstanding all the weariness  and exhaustion of his frame, prevented him  from enjoying the slightest slumber.</p>

<p>But the pangs of his body fell infinitely short  of those of his mind. An absolute certainty of the  most awful fate that could befall humanity stared  him in the face; and often, notwithstanding all his  attempts to exercise fortitude, made him shudder  and sweat with the agony of the reflection. And  then his Maria---his tender, his faithful, his lovely  Maria, the delight of his eyes, the joy of his soul,  the inspirer of the sweetest throbs of his heart, and  the sweetest hopes of his fancy---alas! to her he  could not bid a last farewell, of her beauties he  could not take a parting glance, which his soul  might cherish and brood upon with rapture, as it  took its flight from his consuming body!</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Alas! she---pure, harmless, lovely, helpless and  defenceless, might also be in the hands, and subjected  to the insults and tortures of the merciless  savages, who would now be let loose in all their  wantonness of barbarity, to wreck their vengeance  upon every individual of British origin that should  come within their power! And she---he groaned  deeply as the idea passed through his mind---and  she, alas, was immediately within their power,  the power of fiends, (he mentally exclaimed,) who  will neither regard her sex, nor her youth, nor her  innocence, nor her loveliness! ah, my Maria!  What can thy Charles do for thee? in bonds here  himself, and in wretchedness---Oh, if I could bear  thy misfortunes and my own together, how should I  rejoice! Oh heaven! wilt thou not protect her  whose purity is so like thy own? But why do I rave;  perhaps, thou dost protect her---perhaps, even  amidst these disastrous times, she is safe---oh! to  obtain that assurance, how boldly would I face, <pb n="249"/> how gladly would I endure the fiercest torments  the savages can inflict upon me!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Early the next morning this unhappy young  man was compelled to resume his journey for  about ten miles further, when the Indians again  halted at a place where five or six wigwams were  inhabited by some squaws and children. It was a  small glade of somewhat romantic aspect, surrounded  with sloping hills, and having a pleasant  stream trickling along its western border.</p>

<p>Here a feast was again prepared for the party;  and the prisoners were once more offered  nourishment, of which they refused to partake.  When the feast was over, the sachem Taksuma  assembled the warriors in council to condemn the  prisoners, who were placed on the ground before  them. Charles Adderly's sentence was the first  to be passed, previous to which Taksuma spoke  as follows:</p>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---thank Maneto! We have inflicted  a sweet and glorious revenge upon the oppressors  of our fathers. These oppressors are  proud---they think to grasp the whole earth.---  They robbed and murdered our fathers, and took  more land from them than they can use. That  land they unjustly hold to this day; yet they are  not satisfied. They thought to rob us too, Caughnewagoes!  They thought that we had hearts like  the timid deer, and that they had no more to do  than to shew their faces, and we should fly."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---they say that the mere treading  upon our ground makes it theirs, and they think  that wherever we see the prints of their fect we  should abandon the country."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---they came against us with many  men, strongly armed, and we were few; but the  Great Spirit taught us how to conquer them. I do  not think that they will soon again be so foolish as  to disturb us, for they have been taught a lesson."</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="250"/>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---we lost some of our people by  their steel. Hillsamash, who had fought thirty  battles, and taken three hundred and fifteen  scalps from our enemies, has been slain. That  man before you slew him. I saw him with my  eyes. They grew dim. The sparkles of horror  flashed before them as the horrid steel ran through  the body of my friend."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---he is gone to Maneto. But we  must avenge his death. Are ye for kindling the  flames?"</p>
            </quote>

<p>The assembly signified their assent by a loud  and unanimous acclamation, and six warriors were  ordered to prepare wood for the execution, which  was to take place on the third hour afterwards.</p>

<p>The other prisoner was soon also condemned,  and both were to be bound to the same stake, and  to endure the flames together.</p>

<p>Charles had now become resigned to his fate.  His course through life had, at its commencement,  and for a long period afterwards, promised to be  prosperous and happy. Nay, it had been so.  He had enjoyed happiness, the favour of the public,  the affection of his friends, and the love of  the sweetest female his country had ever produced.  It is true his career had been short, and had,  especially of late years, been occasionally beset  with troubles and perplexities; but this latter period  had also been the time of his greatest rapture  and joy. He had lived long in a few years; and  now, if his hopes and enjoyments were to be cut  off in their very bloom, his fears, his griefs, his  pains, his sorrows, would also be annihilated. The  former might return to him with tenfold increase  of enjoyment, but he had great and consoling reason  to believe that the latter never should.</p>

<p>While he was fortifying his mind with these considerations  for the endurance of the last terrible <pb n="251"/> scene, which he every minute expected to commence,  he perceived a white man hastening down  the hill that rose to the northward. The savages  raised an exclamation of joy, as if they had now  obtained a third victim for their vengeance; and  Charles shuddered when he distinguished the approaching  stranger, whom he believed to be running  voluntarily into the jaws of fate, to be Dr.  Killbreath.</p>

<p>The doctor however advanced fearlessly forward;  and holding out the wampum of Tonnaleuka,  he informed the Indians that he was a messenger  from the prophet, and was immediately received  with an obeisance, and a shout of welcome.</p>

<p>He then advanced to the sachem Taksuma, who  was pointed out to him, and delivered to him the  prophet's petition, according to his instructions.</p>

<p>Taksuma immediately called upon the warriors  to be attentive.</p>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Listen," said he, "brothers, to the desire of  Tonnaleuka, the holy prophet of Maneto. The  prisoner Adderly is not prepared to die. In sacrificing  him, it is only the body, not the spirit, we  wish to punish. Maneto will be offended if we deprive  him of this man's soul, which is not now fit  to go into his presence."</p>

<p>"Brothers, Tonnaleuka, the great prophet, who  declares the will of Maneto, asks the quarter of a  moon of longer life for this man, that his spirit  may, in that time, prepare itself for the company  of the Great Father who made it."</p>

<p>"Brothers, I think we dare not refuse this to  the words of the prophet, for the prophet's words  are the words of Maneto."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The greater number assented with a voice of applause;  but there was a chief, named Remalseh,  the brother of the slain Hillsamash, who appeared  discontented with the decision. Taksuma asked <pb n="252"/> him to say why he dissented from the voice of the  prophet.</p>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers," said he, addressing the assembly,  "I respect the prophet, because I worship and  adore Maneto. I will therefore join my assent  with yours to allow the destroyer of my brother  seven days longer to breathe the air and to see the  sun."</p>

<p>"But, brothers, hear me; I grieve much for  Hillsamash, and long exceedingly to feast my eyes  with the sacrifice of the man who slew him. Is it  not natural? He was a brother who reflected honour  upon our parentage. I could shed tears for  him, but I am resolved never to shed tears for any  thing. That prisoner deprived me of him, and my  heart shall not feel at ease till I see his destruction.  The grief of my soul shall disappear and waste  away, as the flames waste the flesh from the bones  of that man; but not till then."</p>

<p>"Brothers, I shall not oppose the desire of Tonnaleuka;  but lest my indignation against the destroyer  of Hillsamash should not permit me to  bear to see him live the time requested by the prophet,  I shall go westward to hunt, but shall return  on the day of sacrifice to delight my soul with beholding  the torments of the victim."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, he looked in Charles's face, gave a  yell of execration, and hurried from the assembly,  followed by three others, who felt in a manner  similar to himself.</p>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>Doctor Killbreath had now a short conversation  with Charles, in which he informed him of the reprieve  the prophet had obtained for him. "The  prophet would have come himself after you," said  he, "and would perhaps have rescued you altogether,  but for a very unfortunate occurrence  which took place at our house yesterday, and <pb n="253"/> which will require all his attention for a few days.  If he can get off from that business before your  reprieve is expired, I think he will yet save you."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"What, sir, has taken place at your house?" asked Charles fearfully, for he dreaded that something  had befallen Maria.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Why, sir," replied the doctor, "I think I may  as well tell you the whole matter; your heart is  stout enough to hear bad news, I hope, although I  know it will try you a little. In short, captain,  the commander at Du Quesne sent out a party of  troops, who attacked our house, bound the old man  and Archy with ropes, (Paddy and I were from  home) frightened the old woman and Nancy out  of their wits, and carried off---Maria, with whom---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Maria!" exclaimed Charles, "carried off to  Du Quesne! Alas!---Oh, doctor, I could curse,  eternally curse the villains! But what,---oh, in  the name of heaven, what can I do for her?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Nothing, sir," said the doctor calmly, although  he himself felt much on the subject, "but there  are hands at work for her rescue more powerful  than yours can be. I trust they will be successful."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Oh heaven grant that they may!" said  Charles; "but,---ah, these bonds restrain me.  Oh God! why am I thus, when my heart's treasure  is in distress? Oh heaven, is there to be no  end to my misfortunes!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Be calm, captain," said the doctor; "had I  known you would have felt this matter so violently,  I should not have informed you of it."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Talk not to me of feeling violently!" cried  Charles. "Great God! what in heaven or earth  could make me feel violently if this could not!  Oh God! Oh God! that I could act violently too!  then these hell-hounds of Du Quesne should soon <pb n="254"/> learn what it is to molest innocence and loveliness  like hers. Talk not to me of feeling violently:  those who cannot feel as I do, have never loved as  I do. Ah, no! never one loved as I do. Oh,  Lord of mercy!" cried he, fervently lifting his  hands and eyes towards heaven, "save her, save  her, and let me perish!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here the Indians assembling round him, inquired  what was the matter. The doctor informed them  that he had heard bad news from one of his friends  whom he loved tenderly, and that he was thus  giving way to his grief for the misfortune.</p>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Hear me, brother," said Taksuma to the doctor. "I thought not that the white men loved  each other so well. This man bears his own fate  without complaining; but he rages, even to madness,  when he hears of a friend being in distress---  and distress which cannot be more fearful than his  own. Are there many of your people of this temper?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Many among us feel much for the distresses  of their friends," replied the doctor; "but there  are few, I believe, who carry their feelings to such  excess as Captain Adderly does on this occasion."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Sachem"><p>"I honour him for it," said the sachem, "and  shall take care that he be not tortured as the friends  of Hillsamash desire he should, before his death.  He must be sacrificed, for he has slain a warrior,  and is sentenced; but we need not torture him.  Neither the red-hot iron, nor the burning brand  shall be lifted against him."</p>
            </quote>

<p>The doctor took care, in proper terms, to give  due praise to this manifestation of the sachem's  elemency, and informed him that he knew the  prophet Tonnaleuka would esteem him much on  its account.</p>

<p>One of the chiefs now informed Taksuma, that  the hour was come when the other prisoner should <pb n="255"/> be executed. Orders were therefore given to  have him led to the stake. This unfortunate man  took a last farewell of Adderly.</p>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"I go before you," said he, "to the awful  doom. But this is, perhaps, a privilege as my  sufferings will be the sooner ended. I am not  afraid to die; but the manner is terrible. Would  to God that these barbarians would send a bullet  through my heart; they might then consume my  dead carcass as they please. But I must submit  to the tortures, though my soul shudders within  me, yet I will brave it out."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Farewell, Bartley," said Charles, almost suffocated  with grief and horror. "Your fate is, indeed,  preferable to mine. Seven days less of such  mental torment as I shall endure is no trifling consideration.  May God take you to himself!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>They then cordially shook hands, and Bartley  moved towards the stake. He stopped suddenly,  however, when he was a few yards distant, and  beckoned Doctor Killbreath towards him.</p>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"You are a stranger to me, sir," said the victim,  "but you are a Christian and a Briton, and  your countenance bespeaks humanity. I think,  therefore, that you will not refuse to grant an easily  performed request to a dying man."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"If in my power, I will assuredly grant it," replied  the doctor, who felt extremely afflicted at  Bartley's fate.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"You carry a rifle," observed Bartley, looking  at that on which the Doctor leaned.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"Yes, sir," returned the doctor.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"It is charged I suppose," said the victim.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"It is, sir," was the reply.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"My heart would be thankful for its contents  ere these savages commence torturing me," observed  Bartley.</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="256"/>
 
<p>The doctor mused for a moment on the propriety  of granting this request; at length, looking at  the prisoner's entreating countenance, he could  withstand the workings of compassion no longer,  and he resolved to gratify him, let the consequence  be what it would.</p>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"You shall have them," said he.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Bartley"><p>"May heaven bless you," replied Bartley.  "Farewell! I hope we shall yet meet in heaven;" and he marched to the place of execution with a  countenance of joy, amidst the exulting savages,  who not understanding the nature of his dialogue  with the doctor, were astonished to behold his sudden  assumption of bravery and firmness.</p>
            </quote> 

<p>The victim was tied to the stake, the red-hot  irons, and the flaming brands were prepared for  torturning him, and half a dozen of savages waving  these terrific implements in the air, and were rushing  forward to drive them into his flesh, when the report  of a gun was heard, and he fell dead upon  the spot.</p>

<p>Enraged at being thus disappointed in the gratification  of their barbarous revenge, they pursued  the doctor, whom they soon caught, and would  have instantaneously inflicted on him all the tortures  they had intended for Bartley, had not Taksuma  interfered.</p>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers," said he, "be cautious in this matter.  This man is the messenger of Tonnaleuka.  He has, it is true, defrauded you of your just  vengeance against a prisoner, and dared, profanely,  to interfere with the customs of your fathers.  I will not excuse him---but he bears the holy wampum  of Tonnaleuka, and we should dread the displeasure  of the prophet."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Taksuma"><p>"Brothers---Tonnaleuka himself will condemn  his action. Let us detain him prisoner until we  inform the prophet of it. Whatever punishment <pb n="257"/> he may award, we shall inflict. The prophet  knows best how such an outrage should be punished;  or he will consult Maneto on the subject,  and instruct us how to act."</p>
            </quote>

<p>This mode of proceeding was agreed to by the  warriors, and the doctor was confined a prisoner,  with a sentinel placed over him, in one of the wigwams.  Charles Adderly was also confined in a  wigwam, but being the destroyer of a chief, and a  victim already condemned to the flames, he was  more strictly guarded than the doctor, who it was  not supposed, would be so likely to attempt any  desperate mode of escape. Charles was kept constantly  bound hand and foot, with four Indians  guarding him, whereas the doctor's wrists alone  were tied together, and he was watched but by one  sentinel.</p>

<p>Taksuma did not fail to despatch a messenger  in search of Tonnaleuka, to inform him of what  had happened to the doctor. The affairs of Maria  at this time kept the prophet so busily moving from  place to place, that he was not easily traced. At  length, however, the messenger hearing that he  was likely to be found at fort Du Quesne, directed  his course there, and arrived at Grant's Hill at the  time the French soldiers were holding their revels  on that place. The messenger had no disinclination  to partake of the good cheer that was politely  offered him; and after having eaten abundance,  he applied himself with great vigour to the consumption  of the liquors that were handed to him profusely  by some of the merry Frenchmen, who wished  to amuse themselves with his fooleries during  the time of intoxication. He therefore, in a short  time, forgot his errand, Doctor Killbreath, Taksuma,  and every thing but the enjoyment of his  frolic, and consequently did not see Tonnaleuka  for that day, and Doctor Killbreath himself, the <pb n="258"/> reader already knows, saw him in the cavern the  next morning. How this happened was simply as  follows:</p>

<p>The Indians becoming rather scarce of provisions,  had all gone off in small parties to hunt, except  the four who were left to guard Charles, and the  one who kept watch over the Doctor. On account  of being able to speak Indian, the Doctor had  somewhat ingratiated himself with a squaw who  lived in the wigwam with him. On the evening of  the fourth day of his confinement, the Indian that  watched him becoming drowsy, requested this squaw  to keep guard over the Doctor, while he should  enjoy a little sleep. She assented. The Doctor  soon prevailed on this Indian female, who, as all  females should be, was tender-hearted, and more  than particularly so towards the Doctor, to elope  with him, promising her a great many fine things,  and among others, to make her his wife as soon as  they should reach a place of safety, assuring her at  the same time, that his master Tonnaleuka would  not fail to bless her, and procure her the forgiveness  of her friends. The simple lady believed him,  for she loved him.</p>

<p>The Doctor's bands were accordingly loosened,  and off they set, the Doctor trking care to carry  the sentinel's rifle with him, without bidding any  one good bye, and were not missed for nearly two  hours afterwards.</p>

<p>As the Doctor was very impatient to reach  home, he soon outran the squaw; and forgetting  all his former protestations of love, and regardless  of her cries, her tears, and her upbraidings, he cruelly  left her all wearied and forlorn, amidst the  clouds of the night, in the heart of a wild desert,  either to follow him at her leisure, or retrace her  way to her own wigwam, as she thought proper.</p>

     </lg>

<p>The seventh and last day of Charles Adderly's  reprieve from his impending doom at length arrived;  and any faint hopes that he might have harboured  of a final deliverance, were now scattered  to the wind. Remalseh the brother of the slain  Hillsamash, and the other Indians who had gone  off on hunting excursions, now returned to enjoy  the ceremony of his execution.</p>

<p>Charles's feelings were sunk, in consequence of  the intensity of their previous excitement, nearly  to a state of torpor, and he looked upon the awful  preparations that were making for his destruction  almost with indifference.</p>

<p>Very much to the dissatisfaction of Remalseh,  Taksuma prevented the savages from making any  arrangements for torturing him. An altercation  arose between these chiefs on the subject, but the  latter having the authoirty, insisted on keeping his  word to Doctor Killbreath, and the warriors obeyed  his directions. Charles had been informed by  the Doctor of Taksuma's promise, but he entertained  such an opinion of the general wickedness and  barbarity of the Indians, that he placed very little  confidence upon it. When he, therefore, <pb n="260"/> perceived Remalseh, whom he knew to be his inveterate  enemy, disputing with Taksuma, he had no  doubt, from their manner and gestures, although  he understood nothing of their language, that  their contest was on this subject; and as Remalseh  appeared the more violent of the two, he was  confident that he should carry his point, and that  consequently the usual tortures would be inflicted.</p>

<p>This idea aroused him at length from his torpor.  Had they resolved to overwhelm him at  once with the flames, his sufferings would be soon  over, and he could look upon his fate with a stoical  indifference; but the slow, lingering, and excruciating  torments, the endurance of which he  now anticipated, were more than human nature  could bear to reflect upon unappalled. Notwithstanding  all his resolution, he therefore became  considerably agitated, when, as soon as the hour  of noon arrived, they led him naked to the stake,  with great clamour, triumphant yelling, and frantic  exultation.</p>

<p>Remalseh himself tied him to the fatal spot, and  with ferocious barbarity drew the bands so tight  as almost to cut the flesh down to the bone. Taksuma  waited until this inveterate savage should retire  from the victim, in order to give the signal for  throwing upon him the already blazing mass of  wood that was kindled by his side. Remalseh  gave a shout of joy that all was secure, and had  just retired a few paces from Charles, when a troop  of cavalry burst, like a clap of thunder, down the  eastern hill; a loud huzza rang through the air,  while at the same instant, a volley from a number  of carbines levelled Remalseh, Taksuma, and five  other Indians to the earth. The rest of the savages  had scarcely waited to see this slaughter of their  chiefs, but had fled in dreadful panic, in various  directions, into the adjoining woods. In a moment <pb n="261"/> the sword of Washington had cut the bands of Adderly,  and the hapless victim was rescued from the  fire of savage vengeance, ere a single particle of it  had touched his body.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah, is it thou, matchless Washington," cried  Adderly, embracing the hero as soon as his arms  were loosened, "that hast restored me to life?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Ah, knowest thou, wonderful man," exclaimed  Charles---"knowest thou what can make me  happy?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I do know," said his deliverer---"If any thing  on earth can make thee happy, it is the heart and  the hand of the loveliest, purest, and most endearing  woman in the creation---Maria Frazier!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Angel of mercy!" cried Charles, with a wild  mixture of hope, joy, and surprise---"Where---  where is she? Is she still in safety?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Thank God," said Washington, with a half  suppressed sigh, "she is safe from all present danger.  You are now safe also; and may you both  long continue so."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"And it is to you, Colonel, that they both owe  it," said Doctor Killbreath, coming forward to Adderly,  and shaking him warmly by the hand---"I  wish you---from my soul, Captain, I wish you joy,  of both your life and your love. You may thank  Colonel Washington for both. He plunged into  the heart of Fort Du Quesne, and rescued, singly  and alone, my wretched sister-in-law out of the  midst of the Governor's house as safe and unhurt  as she entered it.---But with your leave, gentlemen,  what if we search these deserted wigwams, (for I  perceived the squaws running off, as we approached,  as fast as their yoke-fellows,) for something to  eat; for after our long rapid ride, I confess I <pb n="262"/> should think a slice of venison an excellent  dainty."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"I propose, first," observed Washington, "that  we find some clothing for Captain Adderly; and  then we shall think of what is best to be done for  refreshing our frames."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Andrew Killbreath"><p>"My portmanteau," said the Doctor, "will furnish  him a suit of as good captain's uniform as  there is in the army. I knew the Captain would  be naked; and while you were assembling the men  at the Great Meadows, I provided the dress."</p>
            </quote>

<p>So saying, the Doctor led forward his horse,  unstrapped his portmanteau, and produced a captain's  uniform, of the provincial service, complete  in all its parts, which, although it did not in every  particular exactly fit Charles, answered his present  purposes, and he in a moment resumed a christianlike,  or rather a soldier-like, appearance; and an  unoccupied horse having been brought by Washington's  care purposely for him, he was now able  to take his place among his companions in arms.</p>

<p>On exploring the Wigwams, there was neither  man, woman, nor child, to be found. All had fled  in rapid consternation, the moment the cavalry appeared,  the squaws carrying away the younger  children, and the older ones running after them.  So complete indeed had been the panic, than even  the warriors, who had assembled to witness the  intended sacrifice, had not carried away their rifles;  and Dr. Killbreath, whose rifle had of course  been taken from him when he was captured for  making such an offensive use of it, although he had  replaced it with that of the sentinel, from whom  he had run off, did not now scruple to reclaim his  own, which he found in one of the wigwams, and,  to which, as it had been an old acquaintance, he  gave a hearty welcome.</p>

<pb n="263"/>

<p>As the troops had brought some provisions with  them, they were enabled, with the aid of what they  found in the wigwams, to make a very comfortable  meal, which they had no sooner dispatched, than  they bent their way towards Turtle creek, Washington  being anxious to conduct Captain Adderly  in safety to his Maria.</p>

<p>The squadron of horse consisted of about fifty  in number, Virginia rangers, all well acquainted  with scouring the woods. They did not, therefore,  fear for any force that under the present circumstances  of the country could be hastily brought  against them from fort Du Quesne, or elsewhere  in the neighbourhood. The present garrison of  Du Quesne consisted chiefly of infantry, there not  being more than one company of horse in it, so  that if a French force too numerous to be attacked  with advantage, should appear, they could at  least keep out of its reach by their superior fleetness  and knowledge of the woods.</p>

<p>As their horses had been driven at a very rapid  rate all the way from the Great Meadows to the  place of destination, to which Dr. Killbreath had  been their guide, they now moved at rather a moderate  pace, and it was late before they arrived at  Frazier's.</p>

<p>Here they met with a hearty and joyful welcome;  provisions for the men, and provender for  the horses, were both furnished with prompt and  zealous liberality. Gilbert and Nelly showered  blessings, often and often, upon Washington's  head, for what he had so nobly and gallantly done  for their darling daughter. They had both gone  to Tonnaleuka's cavern in order to visit her, it being  dangerous for her at the present crisis to enter  their house which had, indeed, since her escape  from the fort, been several times searched,  and ransacked by parties of soldiers sent out in <pb n="264"/> pursuit of her. Gilbert had been even told that  De Villiers had threatened to come himself, and  raze it to the ground, if the old man did not inform  him where Maria was to be found. As Gilbert,  however, conceived that this was only a  threat which the governor had no intention to put  into execution, he did not, on this occasion, think  proper to inform Washington of it. The troops  were, therefore, after they had received refreshments,  conveyed to the same dingle where Paddy  Frazier had concealed the horses on the night of  Maria's rescue from Du Quesne. Washington preferred  that they should encamp there for the night  rather than at Frazier's, as being a spot where there  was less danger of being discovered by the enemy,  while it was equally favourable for his setting off  for the Great Meadows, to which place he intended  to proceed the next day.</p>

<p>This matter being adjusted, he retired with  Charles Adderly to pass the night at Frazier's, it  being too late an hour to visit the cavern of Tonnaleuka.  The impatience of Charles to behold  the charmer of his soul, the espoused of his heart,  after her late disasters, was, indeed, so extreme that  he could scarcely brook the delay which this arrangement  occasioned; and it was with difficulty  that he permitted his desire to hasten immediately  to her abode, to be overruled by the persuasions  of the more prudent and considerate Washington.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"She shall not be disturbed from her repose,"  said Charles, in arguing the point. "All I want  is to enjoy the happiness of feeling myself in the  same habitation with her till the morning."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"You will, at least, if you persist in gratifying  this piece of useless impatience," said Washington,  "disturb Tonnaleuka's repose, a matter which  I am sure would give you no pleasure; and, then  consider, that as the prophet may not have <pb n="265"/>  accommodations for you in his subterranean abode, you  might be obliged to sit moping and dozing by the  fireside, either breaking your heart or dreaming  nonsense, till a reasonable time in the morning  should afford you the wished-for happiness. No,  you have, just now, my friend, too much need for  the refreshment of a few hours comfortable rest  yourself after what you have undergone, for me to  permit you to take this whimsical step."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Well! do as you please with me," replied  Charles. "You are not so hot brained as I am;  and, as you do not feel so acutely in this matter,  you can judge more cooly, and, no doubt, more  correctly."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas!" thought Washington, and he heaved a  sigh, "he knows not how acutely, how severely I  feel in this matter."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles was, indeed, as his illustrious friend  had observed, much in need of rest. Ever since  he had fallen into the hands of the savages, he  could scarcely be said to have enjoyed any; and  in spite of all his ardour and impatience to be with  Maria, as soon as he had thrown himself upon a  comfortable couch in one of Gilbert Frazier's  apartments, he fell into a deep and invigorating  slumber, which continued until the beams of  heaven shone full upon his pillow in the morning.  He then arose vigorous, cheerful, and rejoicing,  confident now of proceeding instantaneously to the  presence of his beloved. But he was doomed to  bear another half hour's provoking delay; for Mrs.  Frazier would by no means permit such esteemed  guests to leave her house without breakfast, and  Washington agreed that she should be indulged.  Charles had, in consequence, to submit with  as good a grace as he could assume, and by making  a considerable effort, he was able to smile  off the vexation and chargin, which these little <pb n="266"/> cross-purposes to his wishes occasioned him to  feel.</p>

<p>At length all obstacles were removed, and  Washington set out with him to the cavern.</p>

<p>Maria had suffered much from her anxiety concerning  the fate of Charles; but the attentions of  Tonnaleuka, who had industriously infused into  her mind the consolations of hope and of piety,  greatly soothed, and meliorated her feelings. Tonnaleuka,  however, had not himself any certainty  as to Charles's safety; nay, he had begun to entertain  great fear for the worst, and therefore could  not administer to the afflicted Maria that solid species  of comfort which an unequivocal assurance of  his belief in her lover's safety, would have enabled  him to do.</p>

<p>They were sitting together after breakfast, conversing  about the misfortunes of Charles, when  they heard the sound of persons entering the cavern.</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My child, I have a presentiment that there is  good news approaching us," said Tonnaleuka.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Heaven grant it!" she replied. "But, alas,  I am so accustomed to hear of nothing but disasters,  that---Oh, God of goodness, is it so!" and  the next moment her head was in Charles's bosom.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"My dearest Maria! My dearest love!" he exclaimed;  "have we met---have we, at length,  met!---oh never, never again, while we live, shall  we part!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>For some minutes she was unable to speak;  at length she burst into tears, and found utterance.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Oh Charles!" said she; "it is you, indeed,  whom I again behold. Thanks to a merciful God,  you are yet living! By what miracle has he <pb n="267"/> preserved you from your awful doom? Oh, are you  not yet in danger?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"No, my dearest love," he replied; "I am in  no danger; but that thou art safe---that I find thee  here---that I thus clasp my treasure to my heart  thanks! glory to the God who has thought of us  in mercy! who has rescued us out of distress unspeakable;  who has brought us together in a manner,  indeed, miraculous; by means of an exertion  of such a combination of wisdom, courage, benevolence,  promptitude and energy of action, which  no earthly being but one possesses!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Ah!" cried she suddenly; "I see it; I might  have known it! It is he, it is he! Nothing that  man can do is difficult for him. My deliverer is  thine. Oh, Washington, Washington!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here she advanced towards the hero, who met  her calmly in his manner, but inwardly trembling,  and almost fearful for the steadiness of his own  heart. Ah! when she who reigned over his whole  affections now fondly approached him in all her  charms of youth, beauty, tenderness, and virtue,  could he feel easy, collected, and cool! No;  Washington's feelings were not of a temperament  capable of such stoicism. But he had a soul superior  to his feelings, and capable of controling  every impulse that stood in the way of his duty.  He had now formed within his mind a purpose  which he conceived his duty called upon him immediately  to accomplish. It was indeed a task,  a difficult task. The force of nature was strong,  was almost irresistible against it. But he would  not shrink from it, although his heart should burst  assunder in its performance.</p>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Thanks, thanks, thou incomparable man!"  cried Maria, to the restorer of her Charles and  herself to happiness and each other. "What can I <pb n="268"/> say to express the weight of our obligations to  thee?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Miss Frazier," he replied, taking hold of the  hand which she held out to him; "spare your  thanks. The witnessing of your joy on the present  occasion is an ample recompense for my exertions.  But let me say that it will recompense me  still more amply to witness the confirmation of  your permanent felicity. Captain Adderly," said  he, "give me your hand." Here he for a moment  appeared much affected, and a sudden paleness  came upon his countenance. It continued,  however, but an instant; the cloud passed swiftly  away, and all the firmness, nobleness, and dignity  of America's hero, shone full and bright from his  countenance.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"The struggle is now over," thought he; "and I  am what I should be." "My friend," said he to  Charles; "that lady by your side I have loved,  as I shall never love another. But you possessed  her heart, before she possessed mine. You are  become necessary to her happiness---her happiness,  in competition with which I value my own  as nothing; and I know well that she is necessary  to yours. Take her, my friend; make her your  own; and oh may you be long happy together!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"My best of friends!" cried Charles, almost  weeping with the force of his admiration for his  deliverer's magnanimity. "You---you alone could  be capable of this. I shall not attempt to express  my gratitude. It would be in vain. But a heart  like yours can easily imagine it.---Ah, then you  loved my Maria. I once for a moment suspected  it. But I was secure in her fidelity, and cast the  suspicion from my soul as injurious towards her.  Highly, highly can I estimate the sacrifice which,  on her account and mine, you now make of those  heavenly hopes which must have accompanied a <pb n="269"/> love for her; and highly should I appreciate myself  if I could imitate thee in the magnanimous  self-denial of sacrificing such hopes at the shrine  of friendship and duty. But, alas, I feel that I  am not capable of such virtue. Oh Maria, your  Charles acknowledges his inferiority to that man!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"And well may you without a blush acknowledged  it," replied Maria, proud of her lover's  admiration of the hero, and rejoiced that he did  not hesitate to confess him his superior in virtue  and energetic greatness of mind. "For ah," she  continued, "who can compare with him in virtue?  oh, what do we not owe him!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My children!" said Tonnaleuka, who had  hitherto remained in silent astonishment; "this  scene, indeed, affects me. I knew Colonel Washington  capable of much, but I scarcely thought  him capable of this; for I knew the fervour of his  love for that maiden, and I know with what adamantine  bonds, (said he with unusual energy) love,  like his, binds the human heart."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My children, I cannot speak my joy at this  happy meeting---Oh may the Great Father who  raised up this heroic deliverer for you, make you  long the objects of his care in this life, and in that  of immortality, the inheritors of his eternal love!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>Washington now again addressed Maria, "Miss  Frazier," said he, "there is yet one thing remaining  to set my mind at ease respecting you, that  is, your removal from this desert, where you  are now beset with perils, imminent, innumerable,  and terrifying. I entreat you to leave it  with the man of your choice. Give him a legal  right to protect you in the midst of society. I shall  then be assured of your safety, and become, if  not happy, at least resigned, and perhaps, content  with my lot."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"Sir," she replied, "Captain Adderly is aware <pb n="270"/> of my only objection to the wishes he has often  expressed on this subject. This objection still remains.  If it were removed---but of that I see, at  present, no probability---I will not affect to say, that  I should advance any other."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Oh Maria, my dearest love!"---said Charles,  "Do overlook that objection under present circumstances.  It is one which, under any circumstances,  ought not to intervene between a union of  hearts like ours. It is of too trifling a nature,  surely, to be put in the balance against your safety  and my happiness. Believe me, my love, my  father is not of such a mercenary mind as you  imagine. He will place no importance upon gold,  in comparison to the permanent happiness of his  son. He has both too much liberality as a man,  and too much tenderness as a father, for that."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"But his consent, at all events, should be first  procured," returned Maria. "You are his only  son; he has no doubt been an indulgent father;  and it would be giving him real ground for offence,  if you should take such an important, irretrievable  step without his approbation, nay, without his  knowledge."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Miss Frazier," observed Washington, "these  sentiments become you; they are just such as I  should expect from your acute delicacy of feeling,  and strong sense of propriety. But I am glad that  there are no other obstacles in the way. These  shall vanish. I shall contribute to remove them.  You know me too well not to suppose that I shall  be the obliged party if you accept the offer I am  about to make. It has pleased providence to bestow  upon me a fortune amounting to even more  than affluence. A portion of this I can easily, and  shall gladly, devote to the promotion of a purpose  so dear to my heart as your safety and welfare;  and must beg leave to make over to you deeds of <pb n="271"/> such a property as shall reconcile your future  father-in-law to your alliance with his family. I  trust---"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Ah!" said Tonnaleuka, hastily interrupting  him. "Hear me---Where will your generosity,  your kindness for this young woman have an end?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Hear me, permit me to speak. You have  plunged into the midst of her enemies, and snatched  her from ruin. You have relinquished in favour  of a rival the most fondly cherished wishes of your  soul, to promote her happiness, and now you  would bestow fortune upon her."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"But, hear me, glorious young man! and believe  me, she requires not this last instance of your  generosity. She is rich---as rich, even in worldly  goods, as the father of any man whom she may  make her husband, should wish her to be. She  is my hieress. She is my daughter! my only,  only child! Oh, Maria, Maria! I am no Indian---  I am a son of Europe. Oh, embrace me, I am  thy father!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Maria Frazier"><p>"My father!" she exclaimed, as she threw her  arms round him, and leaned her head on his bosom. "My father, and have I really such a father---  am I not indeed an orphan? But I long felt  it, although I knew it not. I never felt forlorn in  thy presence. Oh, gracious God! thou art kind.  This, indeed, this crowns the mighty blessings  thou hast this day conferred upon me. Oh, my father,  my father! I feel thou art indeed my father.  Why did I not know my happiness sooner?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Daughter of my love!" replied Tonnaleuka,  again clasping her to his heart, "in your infancy  I saw you happy and safe, and I was content. In  the latter years, you were also, until within these  few days, as serene and comfortable as perhaps  the state of womanhood will permit. I would not,  therefore, disturb this serenity of your bosom for <pb n="272"/> no purpose, and I saw none that could be answered  by doing so. I had acquired an influence  over the inhabitants of these wilds by my assumption  of their manners, and of the character of a prophet  among them, which had been often useful to  themselves, and which I believed might on some  emergency be useful to you and to your friends.  I wished, therefore, to maintain this character undiscovered  and impenetrable to all the world, so  long as it might be attended with such benefits.  I perceive that you, and they, and I, must now, all  of us, leave the Wilderness, from whence that  repose, and safety which once blest it, is fled. We  must mix in the ranks of society, my daughter.  The scene will be new to you, and it may for a  while be irksome. But it will afford you safety,  and an opportunity of performing duties, and consequently  of being useful to both yourself and  others, which cannot here be found."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"But, my friends," said he to Washington and  Adderly, "I perceive that you are surprised at  this discovery, and, no doubt, feel a curiosity,  since you find I am not an Indian, to know what  I really am. I shall at present give you but a  brief sketch of my history. At a more convenient  season, I may, perhaps, enter more minutely into  its details."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I set out with my wife, who was attended by  one female servant, in the autumn of 1734. We  were accompanied by six officers, who had also  received appointments at New-Orleans. We advanced  on our journey, receiving assurances of  friendship from the different tribes on our route,  and without meeting with any accident, until we  reached the mouth of French Creek, when unfortunately  our servant girl died, and my wife was  left without any female attendant. We felt this  accident the more acutely, as Maria, which was  my wife's name, was then far advanced in pregnancy,  and there was no possibility of replacing  our deceased servant with another from Canada  previous to the time her confinement was expected.  In this dilemma we heard of an Indian queen  residing on the bank of the Monongahela, not far  from our intended route, whose society, it was  thought, would be the most suitable the country  could afford to my wife under present circumstances.  We accordingly hastened there, and Alliquippa  received us with great friendship and kindness."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"Maria, however, still felt so uncomfortable at  the prospect before her, with only savage women  to attend her, that it was with great joy we were  informed of some white women being in the vici	   <pb n="278"/>dian language, when I spoke in any other, they  conceived that there was something supernatural  about me, and began to reverence me in my insanity,  as a person under the effects of prophetic  inspiration."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"As this opinion of these savages had probably  saved my life, I believed it best when I recovered,  not to undeceive them. I rather took  some pains to confirm them in it. At length my  desire to inquire after my child became so strong,  that I privately left the Iroquois with that intention.  I had proceeded eastward as far as the  Scioto river, when a party of the Mingoes seized  me. I, however, understood their language, customs,  and opinions too well, to feel much alarmed.  The delay in my enquiry after my child, that the  accident would occasion, grieved me most. My  appearance, both as to complexion and dress, was  altogether Indian, for I had, in order to avoid  danger on my journey, used their dyes in colouring  my skin. I also had resolved to avail myself of  the hint which the credulity of the Iroquois had  given me, if I should fall in with any of the  tribes, to pass upon them as a prophet. I therefore  represented myself to the Mingoes as origiginally  belonging to a remote nation of Canadian  Indians, and as frequently having had visions by  which I was instructed to go towards the Ohio in  order to teach the tribes in that quarter the will  of the Great Father."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"It happened that these Mingoes, had, at that  time, some prisoners whom they had taken from  the Ottawas in a battle, and concerning whom they  were the next day to hold a council, which they  invited me to attend.

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I was in consequence of this incident, inspired  with the resolution of remaining among the  Indians for the purpose of using the influence I  had thus acquired, in order to tame their manners,  and restrain their barbarous practices towards  their enemies. With this view, I solicited  adoption into the tribe of the Mingoes, and  their principal sachem, Fallakamsah, who had  lost a son in the late fight with the Ottawas,  received me with all the usual formalities, in his  stead."</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"My desire to make inquiry after my child,  however, still urged me to proceed eastward. I  informed Fallakamsah, that a vision had ordered  me to that quarter, and requested his cousent to  my journey. He at once gave it, observing:"</p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"In a few months, I again visited my daughter,  and formed the resolution of making a concealed  residence in her vicinity. I soon discovered this  cavern; it was naturally well suited for my purpose;  and with considerable labour and perseverance  I rendered it still more so by constructing  its entrance as you find it. It was whilst I was  employed in this undertaking, that my intercourse  with Frazier's family, in the character under which  they have ever since known me, commenced. In  a dell, a short distance from this place, I found<pb n="280"/> Paddy, who was then but a small boy, lying on the  ground crying piteously, with a fractured limb. I  carried him home, and by this means obtained an  unsuspicious introduction to the intimacy of the  family. Previous to this, my visits had been few,  and made cautiously, for I feared discovery from  the superior means which Gilbert and his wife  had of knowing me. I escaped such discovery,  however; for simple and undisguised themselves,  they placed implicit confidence in my story, and  looked upon me to be nothing more than I pretended. "  </p>

<quote rend="Tonnaleuka"><p>"I now became the instructor of my child, and  I felt happier than ever I thought this world could  make me, since it no longer contained her who  had given me the only true relish of existence I  had ever enjoyed. I had no desire to return to  society. My all was here, in the Wilderness.  My child was here, the last sad home of my wife  was here; here was the spot---ah, how often  have I watered it with my tears! where the remains  of her once lovely form were interred.  Here, too, was the theatre of my usefulness to  humanity. By my authority over the minds of  the savages, I have had the happiness to save  many a human being from destruction. In maintaining  that authority, however, I must not conceal  that I was often obliged, in imitation of the  Catholic priesthood in former times, to work miracles;  in successfully effecting which I have  been long greatly assisted by the shrewdness and  dexterity of Paddy Frazier, who alone is in the  secret of my being an European, although he  knows nothing more of my history. It was by his  management that the eagle which was sacrificed  instead of Doctor Killbreath, at Le Boeuf, was  found so opportunely bound to the Rock at Lake  Erie, and numberless other instances---"</p>

<pb n="281"/>

<p>Tonnaleuka, or rather the Laird of Mackintosh,  was here interrupted by the hasty entrance of  Paddy Frazier, with information "that a party of  French soldiers, commanded by De Villiers himself,  had just surrounded his father's house, threatening  to burn it, and to carry the whole family  prisoners to Fort Du Quesne, in order to compel  them by torture to discover the place of Maria's  concealment."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Here was a new trial for Maria, and one which  would have overpowered her, for she felt the  most tender affection for those kind friends who  were thus plunged in calamity on her account,  had not Washington, instantly perceiving the state  of her feelings, addressed her:</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Fear not, Miss Frazier, for your friends. I  have a force at hand sufficient to rescue them from  these tigers of the forest. My life for their safety.---  Father, comfort thy daughter till we return.  And now, Captain Adderly, and you, Paddy Frazier,  follow me!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>He hastened to the dingle where his troops  were encamped. Their gallant horses swept  the ground in full speed, and in a few minutes  the French party were attacked almost by surprise.  The greater number of them fled at  the first onset, and those who stood to give battle,  only stood to be slain or captured. De Villiers  who was a good soldier, did all in his power to  form his men, and prevent their flight. He  mounted his horse, galloped from place to place,  after his flying soldiers, to bring them back, and  those who did keep the field, were retained there  altogether by his exertions.</p>

<p>His exertions, however, were soon ended, for  Paddy Frazier having pointed him out to Charles  Adderly, who had never before seen him, Charles  flew towards him with the rapidity of an eagle <pb n="282"/> darting upon its prey. He came upon him unawares,  and so intense was the bitterness of his  rage against him, that his first impulse was to  strike him to the earth, but he checked his blow.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Turn, execrable villain!" said he, "and defend  yourself."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"In the name of the devil, who are you," cried  De Villiers, as he turned towards his antagonist.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I am the avenger of Miss Frazier's wrongs,"  said Charles. "Knowest thou that name?"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="De Villiers"><p>"By heavens, then, you are her lover, I suppose---  the destroyer of my bliss! Have at thee,  then!" He hastily fired his pistol at Charles's  breast, but the horse of the latter that moment  raising his head, received the ball in his brain,  and fell to the earth, while Charles's sword plunged  into the neck of De Villiers's horse, which fell  at the same time.</p>
            </quote>

<p>In another instant, the combatants were on  thair feet, with their drawn swords in their hands,  frowning terribly at each other, in all the desparation  of deadly rage. They gazed not, they  spoke not, but with fiery speed sprung to the attack.  The sparks flew rapidly from their weapons,  the motions of which could scarcely be discerned  by the eye, while their sounds rang loudly  and fearfully upon the ear. But they did not long  continue to do so. By a sudden side stroke.  Charles dashed his opponent's sword from its direction,  as it was coming with a violent thrust  towards him, and ran his own through De Villier's  neck, who fell to the earth groaning and  pouring forth a torrent of blood, which soon terminated  his existence.</p>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"So perish all the foes to virtue, and the oppressors  of innocence!" cried Charles. "Maria  is avenged! I at length have done something  to deserve her!"</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="283"/>

<p>By this time, the French had all either fled, or  submitted. Gilbert, and Archy Frazier, and Doctor  Killbreath, who persisting in their refusal to  discover Maria's concealment, had, for the purpose  of being carried prisoners to the fort, been  strongly pinioned, were now released, and Nelly  and Mrs. Killbreath, soon recovered from the  fright into which it is natural to suppose these  violent proceedings had thrown them. The family  now hailed Washington as their deliver from  a ferocious and enraged enemy; and the ardour  with which Gilbert and Nelly expressed, in their  simple manner, their gratitude to God, and to  him as God's instrument for their preservation,  sunk deeply into his heart; and he resolved, if  possible, to persuade them immediately to leave  the Wilderness, where they could no longer enjoy  safety, and make their residence for the future,  within the pale of civilization and law.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>Gilbert assented. "Ye hae, wi' the blessing  o' God," said he, "delivered us frae the house of  bondage, an' wherefore should we no submit to  be guided by you to the land o' safety? for I trow  we canna' bide langer here, let us gang whar' we  will, unless we want to fa' into the pit o' destruction."</p>
            </quote>

<p>As Washington wished to proceed without more  delay to the Great Meadows, lest the French  should come out with their whole force from Du  Quesne to attack him, Charles hastened to the  cavern to inform Maria and her father of their victory,  and the consent which all their friends had  just given to accompany the troops to the inhabited  country, and that the whole party now only  awaited their joining them to set out for Dunbar's  camp.</p>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>When Gilbert was informed that Tonnaleuka  was the father of Maria, he manifested the most <pb n="284"/> excessive joy. "Noo, Nelly," said he, "did I  no tell ye mony a time that the prophet could na'  be an Indian. He had aye owre muckle sense,  an' gifts sae like a Christian, that he couldna' ha'  talked better on what was richt an' wrang, an'  what was true religion, gin he had been born at  Maughrygowan."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Nelly Frazier"><p>"An' I aye had a notion," observed Nelly,  "that the French officer, wha was sae affectionate  to his wife, wad yin day or ither come back to  look after his dochter."</p>
            </quote>

<p>Gilbert's horses were soon equipped for transporting  his family from the Wilderness, where the  repose he had long enjoyed was now not to be  found, to the habitations of society, where, if he  should be occasionally annoyed by the clamour of  clashing interests, he should, at least, have the  shield of law to protect, and the forms of religion  to soothe his declining years.</p>

<p>The laird of Mackintosh, or, if the reader  pleases, Tonnaleuka, soon arrived with his lovely  daughter at Frazier's, and the whole party immediately  set off for the camp at the Great Meadows,  where they arrived in something less than  two days. The day following Dunbar struck his  tents, and the army, accompanied by our friends  of the Wilderness, proceeded by easy stages to  the fort at Will's Creek.</p>

<p>It was agreed upon by our party that they should  remain here until a messenger, who was immediately  despatched with a letter from Charles to  his father, acquainting him with the state of his  affairs, his prospects, and his wishes, and soliciting  his concurrence in them---should return with  an answer, which, from the complexion the case  had now assumed, it was not doubted would be  favourable. Although the army made but the delay  of a few days at this place, Washington <pb n="285"/> gratified his friends by remaining with them, until he  should witness the ceremony that was to secure  them to each other for ever.</p>

<p>To keep the reader no longer in suspense as to  the fate of these two faithful lovers, we hasten to  relate, that as soon as old Mr. Adderly received  Charles's letter, he proceeded to Will's Creek, in  order that he might, with his own eyes behold the  charmer of the Wilderness, who had so entirely  captivated his son's heart, as to cause him to reject  some of the most splendid alliances in Philadelphia.  The first sight of Maria removed his  surprise at his son's preference, and the first conversation  with her made him delighted with it, and  he took the earliest occasion to observe to  Charles,---</p>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"It is no wonder, my son, that you became  enamoured of this sweet blossom of the forest,  and felt such an ardent desire to plant her in your  bosom, and carry her to a more congenial air. I  really give you credit for waiting with so much  patience during the slow process of obtaining my  consent."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"I deserve no credit," replied Charles, "on  that account. Whatever is due to my forbearance  in not making her permaturely my own, and  depending on your indulgence afterwards for pardon,  is altogether owing to her. Even at this moment  her consent to make me happy depends upon  yours."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"Then mine you shall have without another  moment's delay," said his father. "Secure her as  speedily as you can, Charles, for I really believe  that she is a prize, and may heaven make you long  happy together!"</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"Thank you, thank you, my dear father!"  cried Charles, and he could not avoid kissing the  old gentleman's hand with rapture.</p>
            </quote>

<pb n="286"/>

<quote rend="Charles Father"><p>"I shall sign and seal articles, as to money matters,  with the Laird this very night," observed the  father.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Charles Adderly"><p>"As you please, for that, father," returned  Charles, with indifference---for he, at that moment,  cared not a farthing for money matters.</p>
            </quote>

<p>In short, in a few days, the great object of all  Charles's desires was obtained. His Maria was  made his own; and the heart of Washington felt  comfort in beholding safety and happiness thus secured  to her for whose fate he had long felt such a  warm and tender solicitude. He, the next day,  bade the bridal pair an affectionate farewell, and  returned to Mount Vernon; while they, with all  their friends, proceeded to Philadelphia. Charles's  mother was greatly delighted with her daughter-in-law.  The sweet rose of the Wilderness was  soon introduced into the first society in her country's  capital, which she continued long to adorn;  and, notwithstanding the seclusion of her early  years, the natural excellence of her understanding,  and the judicious culture it had received from  her father, enabled her to acquit herself so well in  every department of social life, that she soon acquired,  and preserved through a long, useful, and  agreeable intercourse with the busy world, the  esteem and admiration of all who knew her.</p>

<p>Her father resided, cheerful and happy, under  the same roof with her, enjoying amidst the luxury  of ease and literary recreation, the satisfaction of  her presence, and that of her children, for about  twelve years, when he took his departure to join  his long-lamented wife in the regions of immortality.</p>

<p>With respect to Gilbert Frazier, the benevolent  intentions of Washington to bestow upon him  a secure and comfortable residence in Virginia  were disappointed.</p>

   <pb n="287"/>

<quote rend="Gilbert Frazier"><p>"I thank you, colonel," said he, before the illustrious  protector of himself and his family departed  from Will's Creek; "I thank you, frae the  very bottom o' my heart, for your kindness to me  an' mine; baith for what ye hae done, an' what  ye noo offer to do. But I canna gang to bide in  Virginia, whar' there are sae mony black-a-moors,  the very sicht of wham wad gar my flesh creep to  look at. But I'm as thankful as gin I took your  offer; an' I'll no forget, no, while my saul an'  body hang thegither, I'll ne'er forget, to pray for  blessings on your gude heart, as aften an' sincerely  as I'll pray for my ain bairns"</p>
            </quote>

<p>Charles soon discovering that Gilbert's wishes  were inclined towards his former residence on  the Juniata, purchased it for him; and the kindhearted  protectors of Maria's infancy, passed on  one of the most engaging spots on that picturesque  stream, the declining years of their lives  in as much tranquillity, and almost as much contentment  as they would have done at Maughrygowan  itself. Their son Archy, married shortly  after their re-settlement on this place, which he  continued to cultivate until the death of the old  people. It is said that he then sold this farm,  (Paddy having relinquished all claim to it) and  returned to his former residence in the Wilderness,  to which he had always felt a partiality, and  from the vicinity of which, the British arms had  long before expelled the enemy who had occasioned  his friends so much trouble. Here some  casualty cut him off during the war of the Revolution,  after which the family disposed of the place,  and removed to the eastward of the Alleghany  mountains, but to what neighbourhood I have  been unable to ascertain. The place at Turtle  Creek, however, bears, in honour of its original  settler, the name of "Frazier's Field" to this day. <pb n="288"/> As this name commemorates that of the first cultivator  of the Western Wilds, it is to be hoped  that no capricious, cold-hearted proprietor of the  spot, will ever attempt to give another; or if it  should be attempted, that the voice of society  will resist the ungenerous innovation.</p>

<p>The future fortunes of Doctor Killbreath, afford  nothing worth relating. He settled in the practice  of his profession in some town near his father-in-law's  residence, where he remained during  life, and where it is probable that some of his  posterity remain to the present day.</p>

<p>The reader will have observed that our friend  Peter M'Fall does not appear on the scene from  the time he returned to Philadelphia, after the  battle of Fort Necessity. The reason was this.  Shortly after his return to the city, he met with  an Irish sea captain whose ship was about to sail  for Cork. By the assistance of a few kindly  glasses of grog, this captain suceeded in persuading  Peter that there could be no harm in taking a  trip across the Atlantic with him so see old Ireland  once more, because it was as plain as the mizenmast,  that he could at any time put his foot on  board of a ship that would bring him back to his  master, when he choosed to do so. Peter accordingly  set sail for Cork; but he no sooner reached that  port, than the British navy unfortunately happening  at the time to be rather short of hands,  he was hurried without his consent being asked,  on board of a king's ship, which, although she  shortly afterwards sailed for America, she was  so unaccomodating as not to land him there.  At length, by Peter's assistance, Great Britain  having conquered her enemies, she very generously  let him go about his business. He returned  to Philadelphia, and was retaken into  Charles's service; several months after which, <pb n="289"/> in consequence of a series of events which we  have not time to relate, he happened to see the  fair Esther Gist, tripping along the streets. Och!  his heart again warmed to her; he saluted her slyly,  and put the question to her so <emph>nately</emph> that they  were---married. He, and his wife, lived very comfortably  together to a good old age, in Charles Adderly's  service.</p>

<p>As to Paddy Frazier, about the time that his  father re-entered upon the Juniata farm, he established  himself as a merchant in the town of  Carlisle, in the vicinity. He continued this business  very prosperously, till the winter of 1776,  when, hearing of the distresses under which the  army of his favourite Washington at that trying  crisis laboured, he abandoned his merchandise,  collected about twenty smart fellows of the neighbourhood,  well skilled in the use of the rifle, put  himself at their head, and joined the hero of  his country, about three days before the glorious  attack upon Trenton, which turned the scale of  the war in favour of the friends of freedom.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to recount the multiplicity  of exploits performed by this sagacious  and intrepid partisan and devoted follower of  Washington, during the remainder of that memorable  war. Washington, who well knew both the  merits and defects of his character, kept him in  constant employment at the head of scouting,  foraging, manoeuvering, and harassing parties,  for managing which, his genius was exactly suited;  but he never elevated him to any important  stationary command, as he was aware that such a  situation would neither answer his inclination nor  his talents, so well as one less dignified, but requiring  more promptitude and activity. At length,  having frequently received the thanks of his beloved  commander, for the numerous and <pb n="290"/> important services he had rendered his country during  her tremendous struggle for national existence,  he fell, bravely performing his duty, at the very  close of that struggle, greatly lamented by him  who best knew how to appreciate the utility of  his active career. This happened during the attack  upon the British lines at Yorktown. He was  leading on his men, who had on that occasion  exchanged their rifles for muskets and bayonets,  to storm one of the British redoubts, when he  received a ball in his breast. He staggered and  fell. His party would have retired to carry him  off; but waving his hand, he cried---</p>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Never mind me, my lads! push on---you know  your duty."</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>Shortly before he expired, he heard that the redoubt  was taken. "Carry me there," said he,  "and let me die in it." He was obeyed, and laid  on a British mattress. In a few minutes he felt the  hand of death upon him.</p>
            </quote>

<quote rend="Paddy Frazier"><p>"Tell Washington," said he to the bystanders,  "that I die happy, for I die victorious, the death  of a patriot soldier, worthy of having been his follower!" and he expired.</p>
            </quote>

<p>When this message was conveyed to the immortal  chief, now leading on his conquering legions to  their last and most glorious victory, he heaved a  sigh, the memory of his youthful days, the image  of the sweet rose of "The Wilderness," with  whom the idea of the deceased soldier was so nearly  connected, came, like an April sun, with melting  influence, upon his soul, and he briefly said---</p>

<quote rend="George Washington"><p>"Alas! a brave man is cut off in his prime!"  but he mentally added---"so were my sweetest  hopes once extinguished!"</p>
            </quote>

<p>The extinction of those youthful hopes of mutual  affection and happiness in the possession of her  whom he had loved with a fervour almost, perhaps <pb n="291"/> altogether, beyond example, to which the father of  his country here alluded, produced, indeed, upon  his mind an effect which continued during the  whole of his long and illustrious life. Never, after  a dissapointment so deeply impressive upon  his heart, and under which nothing but the strong  sense of duty which he possessed in so remarkable  a degree could have supported him, did he expect  again to entertain the same feeling for female excellence,  or enjoy the same delight in the contemplation  of female charms. To no woman could he  ever again expect to devote his affections so entirely  and so rapturously. Hence he could spare  more of his thoughts to the graver interests of mankind,  he could devote more of his affections to  his country; and since the intensity of love had  now become exhausted from within his soul, he  resolved to cherish patriotism as the passion from  which, alone, he could derive the purest, the  most manly, the most rational, and the most exalted  delight. He never, it is true, forgot Maria,  and the sweet feeling she had once excited in his  bosom; but his country, and her welfare, were, for  the future, the chief objects of his affection. Her  joy should be his joy, her misery should be his  misery, and for her benefit should he exercise the  whole force of his powerful understanding, the  full energies of his indefatigable perseverance,  his invincible courage, and his pre-eminent wisdom.</p>

<p>His heart having suffered much, he became  serious, and contemplative, even in the days of his  youth; but he had done his duty, and hence he was  blest with the consciousness of self-approbation, and  with the possession of a magnanimous firmness, an  independence, and a fearlessness in all his actions  and intercourse with the world. Having parted with  the only object that could engross his whole <pb n="292"/> affections, and being naturally free from every close and  selfish feeling, his heart regarded all men as his  brothers, it cherished his country as his only mistress,  and hearkened to his duty as his only master.  In short, from the day on which it was forced  to abandon the tender hopes of a youthful and  enthusiastic love, it would be impossible to find an  example of human nature having produced a heart  more purely and entirely devoted to all the calls of  philanthropy, patriotism and duty, and productive  of actions more conducive to the benefit of the  world, than the heart of Washington.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
