      <div type="chapter" n="I">
        <p>The noon rush was over in the Herman Puls restaurant, where I was employed as a dishwiper. I had eaten my lunch rapidly, at a book table, near the kitchen door, and was glad to get out into the crisp air of late autumn, and to walk the friendly length of Douglas Avenue, back to school.</p>
        <p>An old man was tying his gray horse to a telephone pole, almost directly opposite the front door of the restaurant. He was stopped, his whiskers were white, and curly white hair flowed in long strands from under his well-worn slouch hat.</p>
        <p>He wore a strangely familiar old gray ulster which had been inexpertly shortened, so that the awkwardly tailored hem flopped about his knees.</p>
        <p>The horse was hitched to a small farm wagon that had seen heavy duty.</p>
        <p>Having tied the horse, the farmer walked rapidly around to the rear of the wagon, picked it up by the axle, and briskly carried the rear end to the curb, so that the rig was properly parked.</p>
        <p>That was my Dad! That was Big Flurry Driscoll, whom I had not seen since he had left home for good, more than five years ago.</p>
        <p>"Well, well, Charlie-bye," said the Old Man, extending his gnarled right hand, "how are you now, I don't know?"I was embarrassed. It is hard to say why.</p>
        <p>"I'm all right, thank you," I said, "and how are you, sir?""Oh, so-so, thank God. I'm getting me strength back fast."
        <pb n="2" />"Yes, I heard that you had an operation." "I did so, at St. Francis hospital. Double hernia they calls it. A fancy name for rupture. I had got so weak that I couldn't pull a herring off the tongs. But I'm all right now, thank God."Yes, Big Flurry looked older; no doubt about that. But how many young men could park that wagon by sheer strength? Not I, certainly. Yet he was past seventy, I reflected rapidly. Though his shoulders were bent, the heroic stature and determined jaw proclaimed that this man had not known defeat.</p>
        <p>"What brings you here, Charlie-bye?""Oh, I work in this restaurant.""So? You work for Herman Puls? Sure, I sell him potatoes this long time, and a fine, square Dutchman he is, too. I'm just going in to pass the time of day with him and to get a cold bite to eat. What work do you do here, I don't know?""I wipe dishes, three hours a day, for my meals. I'm going to school at Lewis Academy, and I'm what they call student help here.""Aye, aye. To school is it? Glory be to God allay, I thought you had schooling enough! You were always reading while the weeds were growing. Maybe it's a priest they're making of you, God save the mark!""No sir, this is a Presbyterian school. I'm just trying to learn something." "To run a restaurant, maybe? Or to be a stenoggaffer, same as Tilly Windhole, that works for Pat Whaley?" (Tillie's real name was Wendell, but Dad always exercised the privilege of changing names to suit himself.) "She was three months in the business
        <pb n="3" />college, and she makes thirty dollars a month. How long is it going to take you?""Well, I'm in my first year here. It takes four years." The Old Man looked at once incredulous and shocked. "Four years!" he shouted, so loud that many pedestrians turned to look. "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Same as Tom Connolly, over beyant the Bishop's house, that spent four years on grammar alone, they tells me! He's a green omathan if ever there was one, and his breath that bad that he can't get a wife!"I recalled the story of poor Tom, the most ineligible [sic] bachelor in our congregation. He had had four years, in elementary school, then called grammar school in our part of the country, and my father assumed that he had spent all his time on grammar.</p>
        <p>"Well, if not a priest, what is it they're making of you, bye?""You see, they don't make anything out of you in an academy. I'm just trying to learn how to learn."The Old Man removed his slouch hat, which had once been white, pointed his neglected Abraham Lincoln whisker toward the sky, and cried with a loud voice, "Now Jazus, do you hear that? Four years to learn how to learn! Jazus forgive me if I've raised another Tom Connolly.'"He paused and looked disconsolately at the sidewalk, sighing and muttering. I stood still, realizing that I had missed my study period, but not daring to leave the Presence until I had been dismissed.</p>
        <p>In a gentler voice the Old Man inquired, "How is your mother?" "Not very well. Better than she was---" I stopped suddenly. I was about to say, truthfully, "Better than she was before you
        <pb n="4" />went away."He asked some questions about the old farm and the crops.</p>
        <p>I asked about his work. "I have a little farm over by Mount Carmel Academy, twenty acres that I bought from Bishop Hennessy. He do be selling off land from the big piece that was given to him for the Academy. I suppose he needs the money to buy some new dhresses for himself, allay, or maybe for to buy a new shift for Miss Bugg that he calls his ward, God save us all!"I could see that my Dad had lost none of his active dislike for the Right Reverend Ordinary of the Diocese of Wichita. He had ceased attending Mass many years earlier, and gave as his reason the inordinate pomp and pride of the Bishop, who, he said, did "too damn much dhressing and undhressing" at Solemn Pontifical High Mass.</p>
        <p>When I timidly asked about his trip to Ireland, the Old Man replied, "I thought I'd spend the rest of me days in Ireland, but I spent eighteen months, and I couldn't stand it any longer. Sure, they're all on the flat of their arse there, but they've been that way so long that they think it's their feet they're on."There was a pause, while he looked me over, and I could see that his eyes were not good. He moved his head close to me as he studied my face.</p>
        <p>"I makes out all right with me little farm," he said meditatively, "and the Lord has given me good crops. I got a man to take care of me few pigs and chickens while I was in the hospital.</p>
        <p>"Well, 'tis with a lot of blarney I've been keeping you, me bye. You would rather be back in school, learning how to learn. I suppose that costs money, too?"
        <pb n="5" />"Yes, sir, it costs some money."He thrust his hand into his overalls pocket and brought out two silver dollars. As he put them into my hand he said, "Well, don't let it be said that I didn't do me share. Here's two dollars for you, and God bless you that you don't waste them!"Then he turned toward the restaurant and gave me my dismissal. "You'm best be going now, bye, and God go with you."I started off, but had gone only a few steps when, the Old Man turned from the door of the restaurant and bellowed after me, "You looks thin, bye, like a pig with no tit to suck! I'll be afther telling Herman to feed you betther!"To this I made no reply, but looked about to see whether anyone I knew was within hearing of the loud sailor's voice.</p>
        <p>I prayed that Herman Puls might be out when the Old Man went in with his message. I had a good job here, and I feared my considerate boss might resent interference from his customer and potato purveyor. True, I was thin and pale. I had little time for eating.</p>
        <p>__________When it had been decided by my brother Van and me that we were going to school, despite hog cholera, floods, droughts and hot winds, I had chosen Lewis Academy because it offered me a scholarship, and because its course of studies seemed to be what I needed.</p>
        <p>In order to win any semblance of consent at home, I had to agree to certain restrictive stipulations. I must live at home, driving a horse to a cart, to and from school.</p>
        <p>I was needed at home to help with the chores, and for a full day's work on Saturdays. Even the performance of these
        <pb n="6" />services was considered small enough as a token of appreciation for the privilege of going to school.</p>
        <p>Older Brother John spent sixteen dollars for a two-wheeled, steel-tired wooden cart, with slatted, curved floor and a seat with scarcely any back. My steed was a bay colt, Daisy, recently broken to harness, and wild as the Western wind.</p>
        <p>I arose long before dawn each morning, kindled the fires in kitchen and dining room, milked the cows, fed the six horses that were stabled, cleaned out the stalls, ate breakfast, harnessed and hitched up Daisy, and tied her to a post while I went into the house, ate breakfast, washed and dressed for school.</p>
        <p>My books, held by a leather strap, and the bag of ear corn that was to be the horse's mid-day meal, were placed on the floor of the cart, as there was no other space for them. The distance to the feed yard, on North St. Francis Avenue, in Wichita, was six miles, all dirt road which was always in bad condition.</p>
        <p>Arrived at the yard, I unhitched and unharnessed the filly, tied her in a shed, and walked to school, thirteen blocks distant, carrying my lunch in a paper sack.</p>
        <p>The feed yard charged ten cents a day for the liberal armful of prairie hay supplied to the horse; nothing for the space or for keeping yard and shed clean. Each noon I walked back to the yard and fed the corn to Daisy.</p>
        <p>I had signed up for a heavy course, including some extras not usually permitted to freshmen. I was so hungry for knowledge that I sensed the impossibility of learning everything I wanted to learn in four years.</p>
        <p>On most days I had only one study period. At four o'clock
        <pb n="7" />I walked to the feed yard and drive home, arriving about half past five, if all went well, in time for the evening milking, feeding, cleaning, wood-chopping and supper.</p>
        <p>The horse ran away several times on the home drive. She was impatient for her stall and feed, after standing long in the shed. When she started to run I braced my feet against the rail that took the place of a dashboard, and pulled on the reins with all my strength. With a plain driving bit you couldn't stop or slow down a lively horse by mere weight of pull.</p>
        <p>Three times my books were scattered over a mile or more of road. When I had Daisy under control I had to tie her up and walk back, gathering my books and papers. I kept still about these incidents at home until one evening when an unguarded sentence about a lost essay brought questioning.</p>
        <p>"You see, he's ruining the horse, as I knew he would," John remarked dourly. John was notorious as the worst driver in the Valley. But he had never been enthusiastic about this venture into the higher learning, and raised many objections to it.</p>
        <p>The granary was full of sweet potatoes that autumn. John had rented the sandy thirty acres east of the corrals on a share basis, and our share, not having artificial heat, such as regular sweet potato growers supplied in their storage houses, had to be disposed of before severe cold weather. Each potato had to be handled, cleaned, the long tail broken off, the top trimmed. This was all done with bare hands.</p>
        <p>Because of my educational privileges, it was assumed that I would be happy to do twice as much work as anybody else.</p>
        <p>After supper and the bedding down of the horses, two coal-oil lanterns were hung to the rafters in the granary, and such
        <pb n="8" />members of the family as could be spared for the work sat on gunny sacks, on top of the great stack of sweet potatoes, working at this disagreeable task until near midnight. Mother always found time to Join the task force for an hour or two, at least, and did more than her share of the work, without regard to the resultant damage to her hands"/&gt;This program left me almost no time for study. I was getting low marks, deservedly. After the sweet potato work, I had neither time nor energy for study. I slept a few hours, and was up for another day.</p>
        <p>I had learned that many of my schoolmates worked for part or all of their expenses. They had time for study, and some even had spending money. I talked to tall, strong, long-nosed, agreeable Hallie Shaner, son of a wheat farmer, about my problem.</p>
        <p>"I work three hours a day waiting table," he said. "It's not hard work at all, after the farm. I'll introduce you to the proprietor, if you want me to."So I met blonde, good-looking, capable Mrs. Rita Hollingsworth. This lady, of Swedish blood and culture, soon became my first employer.</p>
        <p>Looking for lodgings, I found a small room in a one-story frame house, directly across Market street from the Academy. The house had four rooms, with a small coal stove in the living room, gas range in the kitchen, no heat in the bedrooms. There was one gas jet on the wall. We would have to furnish the Welsbach mantel for the light,A farm boy from Rosa Hill was my partner in this venture. He was Morris Poston, thin, blond, good-natured, humorous lazy, and a fair student. His people farmed, rather lackadaisically, an upland farm that gave no great encouragement in yield.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="9" />But there was a rich great-uncle in Topeka, a lumber king. He had generously promised to look after Morris's education so long as the boy wanted to go to school. Morris could have lived, at the relative's expense, at the aristocratic Hotel Carey, or in the best student-teacher room-and-board house in the neighborhood. Because of a tender conscience, he chose to live with me in the cheapest quarters to be found, although some slight discomforts were involved.</p>
        <p>The rent would be fifty cents a week each. There were reasons for this bargain not associated with the nature of the accommodations. Our landlady, Mrs. Leonard, was a hard-working, distraught lady, mother of two young children, and wife of a red-headed fireman of the city force. Her husband worked nights, as well as days, because the idea of double or triple shifts for firemen had not been dreamed of. Mrs. Leonard had a burglar phobia. She never stopped to think that no burglar in his right mind would attempt unlawful entry to that sorry little shack. She suffered from fear by day and by night, and her husband, who was not the gentlest of firemen, consented to her acquiring protection by getting two fairly husky farm boys to sleep in the front bedroom. I made my decision, and, along with Poston, contracted to take the room at the established rental. Then I told Mother of my decision and of my arrangements. It was noted that fifty cents a week was a lot of money, but I knew Mother would find it. She did.</p>
        <p>A matter of social standing cropped up at home. Should a Driscoll become a waiter? We were land owners. We did not "work out," but were sustained by the land. What would people say, seeing one of the family in the garb and position of a servant?</p>
        <p>To all these discussions, I contributed nothing. I said,
        <pb n="10" />"I start my new Job the first of the month. I will leave the horse at Butler's stable."So I found myself in a waiter's apron for the first time at Mrs. Hollingsworth's restaurant on Main Street, meals fifteen cents. My classmate, Shaner, was beside me, telling me in detail what to do. I had never done housework at home, so the handling of dishes and food was strange, but strangely easy to learn.</p>
        <p>I lasted two weeks in this job. The suave Swedish lady fired me, and Shaner furnished the information that my downfall was caused by my eating too much pie. Student waiters got one piece of pie at dinner, as did paying customers. I was gaunt, anemic, hungry, and ate the come-back pie as well as my allotted slice. This was interpreted as disloyalty or inefficiency; anyway it couldn't be borne.</p>
        <p>Within two days I had another job. The place was a foreshadowing of today's tea rooms. Food was good, but prissy. The waiter remembered items ordered, and price of each, making out the check accordingly. This waiter, having no head for figures, seldom got the totals right. So I was out on the street again.</p>
        <p>Outside of school hours, I walked the streets, seeking work in direct exchange for food. On Saturday and Sunday I lacked one cent to buy a cookie I craved. I was hungry, and longed for darkness, that I might break a window and eat.</p>
        <p>I applied at the aristocratic, white-fronted restaurant of George Puls, on Douglas Avenue, in the heart of the business area. Mr. Puls, well-fed, quiet, smiling German-American, said, "We do not employ students. Our customers pay twenty-five cents a meal, and expect expert service. But my brother, Herman, has a fifteen-cent restaurant, several blocks east of here. He might have a job
        <pb n="11" />for you.""Thank you, sir; I shall apply there immediately."Hesitantly, the polite proprietor said, "If you would like to have a good meal as my guest, just to see what we have here, I would be happy to serve you myself, Turkey with dressing today, and six side dishes."Fear that he knew of my hunger possessed me. I said, "Thank you, Mr. Puls, but I have just eaten. I'll come in some other time if I may."The half mile to the Herman Puls place was a long stretch. Herman Puls received me graciously. Long afterwards I learned that his brother had telephoned him, asking him to employ a hungry student. That afternoon I learned to wipe dishes faster than any housewife has yet imagined.</p>
        <p>That is how I happened to be walking put of this eating place when Big Flurry was tying his horse.</p>
        <p>
          <pb n="12" />

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="II">
        <p>Mother, in the middle fifties, and John, about thirty-five and strong as a plow ox, had most of the responsibility for running the farm south of town, now, although Van and I came back for work during summer vacation periods, and I frequently managed to get away from restaurant work for weekends or holidays at home.</p>
        <p>Van, my elder by three years, was struggling with a heavy dose of the classical-religious curriculum at St. Benedict's, in Atchison. He came home for Christmas holidays. It was easy to see that major changes were coming over him. He no longer worried much about family finances. The monastic atmosphere of the Benedictine school had removed him from such concerns. He had reached the conclusion that he had earned on the farm whatever the farm would have to put out for his education.</p>
        <p>Van was taking a more tolerant attitude toward me than he had held while we were together on the farm, day by day. He liked my idea of working at a menial job, but said he wouldn't do it. School work was hard enough, and took all of one's time. Of course, he would, admit, with a tormenting smile, maybe at a Protestant school, where they taught you to mispronounce Latin, there was plenty of time for wiping dishes and indulging in class scraps. Nothing of that kind in his school, and no fooling around with girls, either.</p>
        <p>Marie, the eldest sister, who drove four or five miles from her home with her babies to visit Mother, every week or so, settled
        <pb n="13" />the family attitude toward my going into service as a waiter and dishwiper. While the family still was looking askance and wondering what would become of a boy who so far forgot his rearing as to work in a restaurant, Marie issued the bulletin. "I'm for him," she said, "and I'm going to the restaurant for a meal and I'll be honored to have him wait on me, as soon as he works up to a waiter's job again." After that, the eyebrows were not lifted, anywhere about the family premises.</p>
        <p>Van and I, during reunions, compared notes concerning our schools, [sic] It was quite apparent that education didn't mean the same in the two institutions. We fought over difference in Latin pronunciation. Van had the advantage with the judges, because his Latin was taught by priests, and, obviously they ought to know what they were talking about. I explained that there are at least three widely recognized systems or modes of pronunciation, and that mine was more widely used in this country than his.</p>
        <p>We came to blows over the pronunciation of the name Caesar, in Latin. We fought all the way across the wide lawn. I gained the victory for the kai-sar pronunciation by knocking Van over the three-foot terrace, so that he could not rise without my permission.</p>
        <p>Mother listened intently to our accounts of school life. The religious atmosphere at St. Benedict's impressed her, and she thanked God that Van had the great blessing of daily association with such holy men. Yet she observed that my table manners had improved, as well as my general social behavior. I said "please" and "thank you" at the table, opened doors for women, and performed many other acts of courtesy that had not been in the curriculum of the country school. Association with girls, Mother remarked, had much to do with a young
        <pb n="14" />man's manners. She looked with disappointment upon Van's obvious lack of these citified refinements.</p>
        <p>As to class fights and track meet practice, Van derided them as childish enterprises in which heretical students were often injured while wasting their time and their parents' funds. In this he had the support of Mother's opinion, but John was highly amused by my tales of wild scrambles and unlawful adventures.</p>
        <p>I had led a group of freshmen in an enterprise of great moment. Late at night we had entered the Academy building through a rear window, sneaked up several flights of stairs, climbed into an attic above the chapel, bored two holes through the ceiling, and let down cords to which we attached our class banner. The banner, pulled up tightly against the ceiling, faced the student body next morning, flaunting our class numerals thirty feet above the heads of the enraged faculty.</p>
        <p>At another time, gaining entrance in the same way, we took advantage of a painter's ladder, climbed to the gable end of the chapel's interior, and painted our numerals on the wall paper.</p>
        <p>Van decried such nonsensical capers, and said he presumed that I had spent the two dollars Dad had given me to pay for damage to the wall paper. Mother admitted that this was highly probable, since I could give no satisfactory accounting for the two dollars.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, I had hoarded the money carefully, and, over a period of months, spent it in small doles for candy, which. I craved, and for pencils, French books that I found at a dime to twenty cents each in a second-hand store, and for school supplies. But Van's surmise as to the supposed defalcation was accepted by the family as a proper indictment, and I was often reminded of it.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="15" />At no good Catholic school, I was told, could such expensive nonsense be indulged in.</p>
        <p>At Christmas vacation and during summer holidays it was observed that Van was becoming increasingly nervous, that he seemed unable to continue at one task for any length of time, and that ha was becoming physically more and more frail. He talked incessantly about trivial things of school life, and repeated the same stories so often that I had them by heart. I recited what Father Boniface said, what Van saw on the one occasion when he was allowed to go downtown in Atchison on an errand for Father Director, and what was said by O'Sullivan when he bet Stanislaus ten Hail Marys on the outcome of a baseball game.</p>
        <p>Van became enraged and beat me with his fists when he could catch me, on such occasions. John adopted a tolerantly interested attitude. Van's repetitious story-telling did not seem to bore him in the least.</p>
        <p>Life in a boarding school is apt to cause the student to emphasize trivial Incidents and sayings, even as does life in a hospital or prison. I felt that I had been fortunate in getting into a day school in a big city. The work in restaurants kept me in touch with adults of the great world, and daily I walked the teeming streets. I saw runaways on Douglas Avenue, climbed to the top of the Courthouse tower, and talked with storekeepers and leaders of the Y.M.C.A. I felt that I was a man of the world in comparison with my cloistered brother. I did not dare criticize any of the acts or teachings of the Benedictines, but privately I considered it odd of them to pray daily beside their own graves. The preoccupation with the thought of death seemed to me to be somehow connected with Van's obviously
        <pb n="16." />failing health.</p>
        <p>Van consulted our family doctor, who found him anemic and prescribed a tonic. At the end of the first Christmas vacation I returned to school gladly, anxious to take up the magic thread of learning where I had left off. Van returned reluctantly, shedding tears openly as he left.</p>
        <p>Homesickness in a virulent form had cast its net of melancholy over my tall and nervous brother. School was not what he had expected it to be. The circumstances of his having to associate with boys so much younger than he, his total lack of outdoor exercise, and overstudy; all these helped to undermine his health and lower his morale. He blamed the gravy. He deplored the food served at the school, and repeated the old, old story that the monks put saltpeter in the meat and gravy to keep the boys from thinking about girls. This story has been told in every boys' school I have heard of, as well as in the armed forces. If all the saltpeter alleged to be fed in these places ware assembled for even one day, the world itself, I think, would not contain it.</p>
        <p>The second semester had advanced only a few weeks when Van wired for railroad fare home. He had an infected tooth, and must see the family dentist. There were dentists in Atchison, but Van said they were no good and that his tooth was a very special kind of tooth which no village quack could understand.</p>
        <p>When he arrived it was obvious that homesickness and nervous unrest were far more serious ailments than the toothache. Van made the most of the dentist appointments, dragged them out, and sat on the front porch talking, talking, talking endlessly to Mother end John. He was gloomy now, discouraged about his school work, resentful of the young boys who made better grades than he,
        <pb n="17." />and worried about his career, already so long delayed.</p>
        <p>"I can't learn Latin as fast as Ed Courtney and some other young kids," he said. "I study hard all the time. I almost never go out on the playground. I take walks with some of the monks, but that's all the exercise I get."I often came home for Saturdays and Sundays, getting some other student to take my place at the restaurant. When I heard Van talking about lack of exercise, I said, "You ought to be glad you don't have to wait table or wipe dishes for your food and walk a mile to and from the restaurant three times a day. That's six miles, besides the exercise at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>"You always were too lazy to work anyhow, so I guess you like it up there, sitting on your rump and blowing with the monks.""Well," replied Van, knowing one sure way to get the better of me in any argument, "I don't have to sing Protestant hymns and go to a Protestant chapel every day to indulge in false worship, anyway. You'll grow up to be a Methodist preacher, and a mighty ignorant one at that. Your Latin is just about good enough for a Methodist."__________As to the religious phase of my adventure into the higher learning, Mother was beginning to be reconciled. I never missed Mass, and I was still excused from Bible classes at the Academy. Kindly, white-haired Principal Naylor praised my work and conduct to Mother when she visited the school, and said nothing about the devilment I was constantly mixing in.</p>
        <p>I reported an amazing discovery to Mother and John:
        <pb n="18" />"Educated people are not intolerant of anybody's religion. It's only these wild, ignorant clodhoppers, such as we went to school with here in the country, that beat people up for going to Mass. I haven't been called a Damn Ole Kafflick since I started to the Academy. Within a few weeks after the beginning of the school year the whole student body elected me editor of the school magazine, and not one voted against me. The students and teachers are all just as nice to me as if I were a Presbyterian. Even when an evangelist comes to get the students to make pledges and such, they never talk to me or try to convert me. Protestants are just as good as Catholics, except when they're ignorant and barbaric."Mother was pleased that we boys wore at last out of the atmosphere of religious hatred and persecution that dominated our boyhood. She was proud that I was carrying the editorship in addition to my heavy school work and outside work. Soon word came that Van had been chosen to the staff of his school magazine, a heavy literary publication called The Abbey Student. Within a year he was editor.</p>
        <p>Mother told John that education was a great thing for a family, and that we should have to see the boys through school at my cost.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="III">
        <p>Farm work did not prosper after we boys started to school. John could not afford to hire two men to take our places. He accepted an offer that seemed fair for rental of the east thirty acres of sandy ground. The renter was hard-working, successful Elzy Brown, who had bought the farm across the road to the north.</p>
        <p>Brown was the son of a Quaker minister and farmer. He and his friendly wife worked hard, minded their own business, paid their debts promptly, and prospered. The two brothers of Elzy helped with the farming, and the old gentleman, who had moved totown to live in quiet retirement on a five-acre tract, made regular visits to supervise and advise.</p>
        <p>The sweet potato field was east of our livestock pens and adjoined the Brown farm on the north. Thus the tenants could come and go about their work without bothering the Driscolls. They paid cash in advance, which was welcome money.</p>
        <p>We had never made much out of that field, and John was glad to be rid of the responsibility of keeping down sunflowers there. The land was low and often flooded where it bordered the corrals, was fairly rich over half its area, and extremely sandy in the other half. The Browns raised a fine crop of sweet potatoes on it that summer. They kept the land absolutely free of weeds by constant hoeing. They made plenty of money out of the venture, and continued to rent the tract for several years thereafter.</p>
        <p>Most of the good ground on our farm was now in alfalfa, but since the hogs had died of cholera and the herd had not been replaced, the crop, which made four tons a year in four cuttings, was stacked and sold. During the first and second summers of our
        <pb n="20." />school careers, Van and I were home to help with the alfalfa crop.</p>
        <p>Van was even less sturdy than he had been before going to school, and confined his alfalfa labors to operating the slacker. I ran the go-devil, or push-rake as it was called by all who did not like to say devil. This required skill in driving and strength in operating the lifting lever. I was in much better health than before starting to school. My heart gave trouble occasionally, but I could outwork most hardened farmers in a long day under a sun that often made 110 degrees in the shade.</p>
        <p>John did the stacking, and a good job it was. Alfalfa harvesting in those days and in that area was done thus. The grass was out with a six-foot McCormick mower as soon as it was fairly in bloom. In hot weather it was raked into windrows the same day, since it must not be allowed to blanch in the blazing sun. Van often operated the one-horse or two-horse rake; John usually ran the mower.</p>
        <p>The go-devil was a rakish implement, the rake part being about twelve feet long. It ran on low wheels, and one horse was hitched on each side of the rake. The driver's job was to make the two horses, thus widely separated, work together with precision.</p>
        <p>With the go-devil astride a windrow, I drove the horses into a heavy push, until the rake had taken on all it could hold, about a quarter of a ton. Then, assisted by the pull of the team, I pulled o lever that lifted the laden rake a few inches off the ground. Driving with as much economy of motion as possible, I carried the load to the stacker and deposited it on another rake, which exactly matched the push-rake. A single horse hitched to a hoist was started, the load rose to the top of the stack, and was
        <pb n="21" />there deposited for John to spread and arrange with a pitchfork. This was hard work, and John did not shirk it.</p>
        <p>Mother often brought pitchers of cold water or lemonade to the stack, and the three hands took a recess to drink. We were soaked with sweat, John and I dripping and uncomfortable from scratching of dry alfalfa leaves that were caked inside our clothes. Van had begun to exhibit symptoms of serious psychological disturbance. He tried to keep most of it from me, lest I make fun of him, but talked incessantly with Mother about his condition. He ceased going to church. He explained that he was not only afraid of the crowd, but of the church tower. The very thought of the squatty belfry, which he pictured as a high steeple, cross-surmounted, made him ill. He turned pale, shook, and vomited. He could not even think of the steeple while working the stacker without running home through the orchards and crying on the back porch. Then I had to do his work in addition to my own, and the harvest went slowly.</p>
        <p>It was high time that Van should see a doctor, everybody agreed. He would not ge to town alone. He feared that he might throw himself in front of a trolley car. He said this impulse was so strong when he approached a trolley track that John must hold on to him.</p>
        <p>This was all mysterious stuff to a matter-of-fact farm family that knew how to cope with croup, typhoid, pneumonia and carbuncles, but had little time for fancy psychotics.</p>
        <p>Nervous exhaustion, coupled with extreme acute anemia, said Doctor Martin Hagen, a good Catholic who meant well but knew little more about psychological disturbances than did the farmers. He
        <pb n="22" />prescribed Fowler's Solution of Arsenic, and Van's nerves quieted so much that he slept nearly all day and much of the night during the rest of the summer. He did little farm work.</p>
        <p>In his waking hours, Van worried about his education and career. He had decided to become a lawyer, but must finish his prep school work before he could enter Creighton University Law School, in Omaha. He had picked this school on advice of some alumni of St. Benedict's who had graduated there.</p>
        <p>The neurotic's condition was in no wise improved by advice of neighbors. Those who heard something about the case hastened to pay a visit. Van didn't want to see them and feel their scornfully diagnostic gaze upon him, but he craved companionship, and talked.</p>
        <p>The advice, in most instances, ran something like this:"You'll have to pull yourself together, boy. No time for loafin', with the sunflowers a-growin'."Serious business was afoot now. Mother was taken ill with influenza which developed into pneumonia. There was no way of caring for her properly at home. The doctors ordered her to St. Francis Hospital. Jimmy Howard, eccentric livery stable proprietor, owned the only ambulance in town. It was black, looked like a hearse, and was drawn by two gentle black horses.</p>
        <p>Jimmy drove, for the families were old friends. The trip, at a walk, over rutty roads, took two and a half hours. The hospital was in the North End, in a quiet neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Mother was happy in the hospital, waited upon by sad but pious Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. She had to be severely disciplined by one of the chief nurses in order to convince her
        <pb n="23" />that she must not get out of bed to visit the toilet. Having lived most of her life with primitive toilet facilities, she considered it a work of supererogation to supply expensive indoor toilets and then forbid a patient to use them.</p>
        <p>An Irish priest with but little education, great zeal and bad judgment, visited the patient daily. The family visited also. It was evident that, while Mother never complained, the case was not progressing favorably.</p>
        <p>Van was at the bedside, as was also the priest, when Mother, who could talk freely but weakly most of the time, asked the Father's advice about Van's problem. Van supplied the information that he was going to study law as soon as he got well enough.</p>
        <p>"Too much education and pride of intellect!" the reverend counselor [sic] almost shouted.</p>
        <p>"Let him stick to his groove! Law, indeed! He was born of peasant people, and to the soil he should stick. No good can come out of pride, the sin of the peasant that wants to be better than his people. Stick to your groove, young man, and you won't be sick of mind and body!"Van, with inflamed eyes blazing, left the room at once, rather than argue with the holy man in the presence of his sick mother. But to his very last day on earth he imitated, derided and cursed that ignoramus who told him to stick to his groove.</p>
        <p>Although the patient did not seem gravely ill, two doctors who were now handling her case decided that she might have some fluid in the pleural cavity, and indicated that they were going to find out. So, without anaesthetic, they performed the operation, at that time quite popular, called thoracentesis, an aspiration
        <pb n="24" />of the pleural cavity with a needle driven into the chest from the back while the patient was seated on the edge of the bed. There was no fluid in evidence. Mother nearly died from shock. When I saw her many hours later she was trembling, weak, white and uncertain in her speech.</p>
        <p>A few days later, her calm and confidence having been restored, Mother told me that the doctors were preparing her for a major operation, which they had warned her would be serious. She had been receiving Holy Communion every morning, she said, and was prepared to die.</p>
        <p>She did not shed a tear, but lay smiling as she assured us that she was not worried about anything, and that if her time had come it was no tragedy, but the situation that all of us must meet. She would be happy to meet her lost children in heaven, and we would all be together there in God's own good time.</p>
        <p>When they rolled her to the operating room, we all kissed her, and she said she would pray for us as she went to sleep.</p>
        <p>The surgeons, still on the trail of the elusive pus and liquid, performed a resection of two ribs and opened up the pleural cavity, having diagnosed the case as empyemia. John was told that he might stand by as a witness during the operation, and was warned of a possible explosion of pus. Mother elected that John perform this duty, and, reluctantly, he did.</p>
        <p>There was no pus, according to John's testimony, but the medicine men, willing to justify themselves, did some jimmying with a spoon, and pretended to have found a little bit.</p>
        <p>Mother made a remarkable recovery. She was home in a month, and enjoyed being waited upon for once in her life. She was
        <pb n="25" />cheerful, spent much time in prayer, and said she knew she had been spared specifically for the job of seeing her two sons through school.</p>
        <p>She was never again as strong as she had been. She was slightly crippled on the side from which the ribs had been removed, and for the rest of her life had to be assisted upstairs, or when stepping up or down at a curb or other obstruction.</p>
        <p>Van cursed the doctors openly, refused to subject himself to the abracadabra of these men who had almost killed Mother needlessly, and hunted another doctor for his nervous condition. This doctor was of some assistance, though he was not sober at any time, so far as we ever learned. Van said that an honest man drunk was worth all the sober, pious fakirs in the country.</p>
        <p>Aunt Fannie sent money for railroad fare, and, on a glorious spring day, we saw Mother off on a train for her old home Back East. Since her delivery from the shadow of death, she had often spoken of her lifelong desire to see Niagara Falls. The great natural wonder was only a short ride from Erie, where Mother had spent her girlhood and early married life, but she had never seen it. She scrubbed and washed and sewed, smilingly and happily. I believe that this interlude was the most serene period of her life, which had not been marked by great happiness.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="IV">
        <p>School life was glorious. There was a small library, containing not more than a thousand volumes, in wall cases, and one long table. My first resolution was to read every book in that collection, and I went about the job systematically. I drew a history of the world on my first day at school, read it steadily in spare time, and when it was finished I took to my room histories of England, France, Spain and the Napoleonic WarsAll through the four years at Lewis, I found time to read books not required in the courses. I was piling on the work. I carried five and six major subjects, always including one of collegiate status, in the hope that, if I succeeded in getting to college, I might shorten my stay there with recognized credits already accumulated.</p>
        <p>The bugaboo of my preparatory course was public speaking. I had been good at "speaking pieces" through most of the public school time, but lost my nerve suddenly, and thereafter was almost unable to stand and recite before more than two or three persons. I was not timid in conversation, but when I had to read aloud in school I lost my breath and my face turned scarlet. I shall always sympathize with those unfortunateswho die one or two thousand deaths when they speak in public.</p>
        <p>I asked to be excused from Friday afternoon "rhetoricals," promising to write speeches for others to read. Benevolent old Dr. Naylor said, "No, indeed! You're excused from Bible, that's all. I want you to be able to hold your own on the platform when you go about your life's work."He told me why he was determined never to excuse any of his pupils from practice in public speaking. Victor Murdock, red-haired and brilliant son of old Marsh Murdock, founder of the Wichita Eagle, had refused to take public speaking when he was a student in the Academy, even though such refusal barred him from graduation. He said he was going to be a newspaper man, and would never need to make a public speech. He was
        <pb n="27" />nominated for Congress while still a young man,"I heard him make his acceptance speech at the Auditorium," said Dr. Naylor, "and I felt like hiding my head for shame. I have never seen anyone suffer so in making a public speech. He stuttered and groaned, while sweat poured off him."Victor, by dint of heavy effort and much practice upon friendly audiences, became one of the best speakers in Congress, was floor leader and whip for the insurgent movement, campaigned often for himself, Theodore Roosevelt and others.</p>
        <p>Well if I had to do it, I had to do it. I wrote an essay about George Washington, shook and perspired until my name was called, and almost collapsed during the reading. It scared me worse than ever when I realized that my knees were knocking together and that everybody in the audience sympathized with me intensely. I choked and fumbled, but managed to finish the reading.</p>
        <p>I was never frightened in making a public speech from then on, and later that season was selected to represent my school in the Arkansas Valley Oratorical Contest, having won over the veteran orators of Lewis.</p>
        <p>Van was back at St. Benedict's now, determined to go through with it though it kill [sic] him. He was gaining in self-confidence. He had completely lost the stutter that had made his boyhood miserable. He was still seriously underweight, and the monks, strict though their curriculum and rules, made certain allowances for Van's maturity, nervous condition, and anomalous situation.</p>
        <p>On one of his returns home, Van related with hilarious laughter and nervous zest a major adventure in which he was loader. Wandering about the sprawling old monastery, he studied the great door that led to the wine cellars. These were tunneled out of solid rock, far back into the hills. The monks raised grapes on their big farms, made wine, and aged it. They were mostly Germans, and the order had always known how to make
        <pb n="28" />good wine.</p>
        <p>The monastery was nearly a hundred years old when Van started to school there, so the precious wines, intended for altar purposes as well as for the monks' refectory, were well aged.</p>
        <p>Van conceived a Great Grand Idea, and at once shared it with a small group of friendly older boys. Together they obtained a roll of wax and a candle. They softened the wax, and, on a night of dark moon, Van personally made two or three excellent impressions of the keyhole and lock.</p>
        <p>On a rare visit-to the town, the boys found a locksmith who made the key "for the Father Director."There were opportunities for the older boys when the monks were at matins, at some ungodly hour in the morning, as well as during other spiritual exercises. The key worked!</p>
        <p>The boys entered the ancient cellar, peered among the mossy tuns, found measuring cups, and turned spigots. They had plenty of good, rich wine.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, admitting none to their secret circle, these boys continued to raid the winery throughout their school course at St. Benedict's. The monks knew nothing about it, and suspected nothing.</p>
        <p>One scruple annoyed the consciences of all the culprits. Was this pilfering a matter of confession? The students knew that, while the confessor was bound by the ironclad rule of secrecy, he could require the penitents, as penance, to go and tell the whole story to the Father Director, not in the confessional, but in the office. Then the forays would, be at an end, and severe sanctions were sure to be imposed. Expulsion might result.</p>
        <p>One of the group who was studying for the priesthood did some serious research, and came up with the doctrinal answer. Only mortal sins are of necessity confessed, he explained. Was this uninvited drinking of the monks' wine a mortal sin on the part of any of
        <pb n="29." />the raiders? No, he announced, and proceeded to expound the doctrine of guilt in case of theft.</p>
        <p>It is not theft to take a drink of water from someone's well, pump or spigot. This vast store of wine was as water to the monastery, and the boys had almost as much right to it as the monks, since tuition and board were being paid for each of them, and they were entitled to much more and better food than they got in the gravy with saltpeter.</p>
        <p>The boys asked for more information in doctrine, some believing that the explanation smacked a bit of sophistry.</p>
        <p>Well, would you confess the sin of taking an extra roll off the platter? No, because it was not a sin, but a blameless attempt to keep body and soul together. Same as to the wine. The boys of this group would advantage by this project of cellar-raiding, while no one would be deprived of anything. The insignificant trickle of wine that would go down the throats of these boys would make them healthier, build up their bloodstreams, and add joy and interest to a dull routine of study and prayer.</p>
        <p>Of course, the spiritual mentor explained, they must not commit the sin of drunkenness, for that would be a matter of confession. He undertook, with consent of all, to limit the amount each one might drink on any raid. The others obeyed him implicitly. They never became intoxicated, though they did experience elation and good feeling.</p>
        <p>Dullness had departed from school life. Van studied as hard as ever, but he began to love the old school and its bearded teachers, for the depth of whose learning he had great admiration. On the other hand, the faculty and students respected Van's ability, as increasingly exemplified in his editing of the Abbey Student, his own precise writings in the purest English verse and prose, and his struggle to excel in spite of obvious handicaps.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="30" />We younger boys were beginning to show sins of maturity when we were at home. Both of us were making good against strong competition in school. Respect shown by faculty members and fellow-students percolated outside school walls, and was noted with satisfaction at home. Van no longer submitted slavishly to John's authority, but enforced treatment as an equal. I could not yet hope for such a distinguished position in the family, but I showed some independence of action.</p>
        <p>As a certain spring came on, and plans were discussed for the summer's farming, I made an announcement, without apology or trepidation.</p>
        <p>"No use to count on me as a farm hand this summer," I said. "I'm going to get a summer Job in town. I can continue waiting table for my board. I have a good job now in Miss Cook's boarding house.</p>
        <p>"I have been offered a job collecting and soliciting for The Eagle. I can work Saturdays in Goldsmith's book store or in any other store. I can save money, buy my own clothes, pay my small room rent, and not have to ask the farm for anything. The way it's been, I work hard all summer and haven't a cent of my own in the fall. I never have spending money, and have to account for every nickel. I'm getting too old for that.""What about your heart? Will it stand the racket?""Well, the town work ought to be easier on it than farm work. It's lifting, stooping, riding horseback and such things that get my heart. Anyway, I've got to prepare for a different kind of life. I'm not going to be a farmer."While the work was not always steady, I earned the first money that I had ever called my own that summer, and profited in self-respect and self-confidence. When work was slow or one job expired, I would ride my bicycle cut to the farm, and lend a hand where needed.</p>
        <p>It was obvious that work was slacking on tie farm. John had sold
        <pb n="31" />some of the horses, and the herd of cattle was growing steadily smaller. Sometimes it had been necessary to take a chattel mortgage on some of the animals, or even on a growing crop, to pay interest on the farm mortgage or, as John put it, "to buy things that we need." Once the chattel mortgage disease hits a farm, dark days are ahead. It seems such an easy way to get money. Dad had never employed it. John soon had all the livestock mortgaged, and was gradually selling it off to pay mortgages when they fell due.</p>
        <p>Mother viewed this deterioration of financial position with concern, but, since sane of the money always went to satisfy Van's needs at St. Benedict's, she hoped and prayed that all would be for the best.</p>
        <p>She had returned from her month's visit in Erie vastly improved in health and in spirits. She told us of the glories of Niagara, of the great expanse of the Lake she had not seen for so long, and of all the relatives Back East. She had stayed with her second daughter, Margaret, who was rearing a family and planning to return to Kansas as soon as her husband could find his kind of job there.</p>
        <p>I was alone with Mother under the shade of the great maples in the front yard, on a Sunday afternoon. She was in one of her rare dreamy moods. She was thinking of Niagara's majestic sweep and roar, of the powerful rapids of the St. Lawrence, and of the peaceful blue of Lake Erie.</p>
        <p>She talked to me of these things, and of the past and future.</p>
        <p>"I want all of the children to see the Falls some time," she said.</p>
        <p>I laughed. "A fat chance I'll ever have to see the Falls," I told her. "Or any of the rest of us, for that matter. Margaret and Marie and you have seen Niagara, and you can tell the rest of us about it."She smiled the inscrutable smile that knew no contradiction, and her gaze was unfocused, as if looking far into the future.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="32." />"It's Poor John I think most about when I think of the Falls. I hope we can get money together some day to send him there for a visit.</p>
        <p>"The rest of you will manage for yourselves. All of you will travel, and you will travel all over the world. You will not live here in Kansas very long, You'll see the Falls and both oceans, and foreign countries, more than most men ever have.""How do you know all this?" I asked, pretending to laugh at the ideas she was expressing, but mightily impressed, just the same.</p>
        <p>"Oh, I know, all right! You will go away from here, far away, and some day you'll come back and be editor of The Eagle,""You are letting your imagination run wild," I said. "Just because I have a job soliciting subscriptions, and sometimes get to substitute for a carrier, I don't think I'm headed for the editor's job.""Just you wait and see," she replied, adding with a sad satisfaction, "I won't be here to see all these things, but I know what will happen."How I have wished that I had encouraged her to tell me more! Instead, I was made vaguely uneasy by the calm certainty with which she voiced her prophecies.</p>
        <p>I remembered how she had looked just that way when she had told me, far in advance, that Margaret would go to Erie and marry Tom Kennedy.</p>

        <p>Marie, eldest daughter of Big Flurry and gentle Ellen, was living on a farm, mostly sand, about four bad miles south of our farm, and came to visit when she could. She was rearing two daughters and a son, all babies, and doing heavy housework without many conveniences. Ed Blood, head of the house, rented the farm, worked hard when he was not on a drinking spree, and seemed to be headed in the right direction, if there was any such direction in that hot, semi-arid valley. But Mother detected disquieting symptoms. To me she said, "Marie will never be able to make a go of it with that man. She will leave him when he goes too far. I want to live to help make a home for her and her babies hare."I thought this a pessimistic prophecy, and pointed out that Ed seemed liberal with his money when he had it. Mother just shook her head and said, "She will stand for a lot, but for some things she won't stand."Sometimes Ed came along, when Marie, after attending Mass in town, drove up for an afternoon with her family. He was agreeable, full of farm talk, and critical of the slipshod farming John practiced, especially after the two brothers were no longer available for heavy and disagreeable work.</p>
        <p>Margaret came to live in Wichita with her husband and family of young children. Her husband had a job in a machine shop, and later a little shop of his own. They had an automobile, one of the first in town, and certainly the first in our family. It was, I believe, a second-hand Jackson. Its operation was difficult, and its behavior on our bad roads decidedly whimsical. We did not see much of the Kennedys.</p>
        <p>I was taking Greek, Latin, German, French and English in school,
        <pb n="34" />studying Esperanto by myself and. taking night classes in Spanish at the Y.M.C.A. I liked languages, hated mathematics, and, took more interest in getting out the school magazine than in any classwork. As frequently happens in larger and more important schools, nearly all the writing and editing devolved upon the editor. The staff was window-dressing,College papers praised our little magazine as the best prep or high school publication in Kansas. So, added effort was necessary to maintain our reputation.</p>
        <p>I tried out for baseball in the spring. When I was felled three times in succession by a pitched ball, I discovered that trouble with the left eye made it impossible for me to determine direction or speed of an approaching object. Despite warning from my doctor on the basis of heart condition, I tried out for pole vault, hammer throw, high hurdles, broad jump and high jump. I landed the pole vault job.</p>
        <p>In the Arkansas Valley Interscholastic meet, I lost to a student named Pruitt, who progressed thereafter to national fame. I didn't go on in athletics any more. I was badly injured when my pole slipped on hard ground and I landed, sitting, on more hard ground. This was partly the fault of my form, which was never orthodox, and partly the fault of the management, which had not provided a cushion of dug-up earth on which to land.</p>
        <p>I was dazed when picked up, but would not be carried off the field. My nose bled a little. I took my position for the next try, went over the bar safely, and fainted.</p>
        <p>That night, despite a fairly bad nosebleed, I competed in the oratorical contest, landing somewhere close to top in our class; close enough to get a silver cup, anyway. But I was dizzy and didn't feel well.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="35" />Next day, in Latin class, my nose suddenly spurted a crimson stream, I walked to a sink in the hall, and began mopping my face with cold water. Suddenly I fell, and was caught by two classmates. I was unconscious for a long time, on the floor until moved gently to the library, where they placed me on the table, my head pillowed upon a precious copy of Skeat's Etymological Dictionary, which had become my favorite book.</p>
        <p>A doctor was called and my family notified by phone. Our rural phone service was new and not working well. It was several hours before Mother appeared, white and trembling. I was unable to talk or move. The doctor injected warm normal saline solution into the veins, and I blinked my eyes. He forbade my being moved until he should give the word, next day.</p>
        <p>Roommate Morris Poston, with Classmates Bill Callahan and Gail Hamilton, kept vigil all night in the library. Bill was handy about helping any sick person. As the sun rose on the weary trio of watchers. Bill announced that he was going to be a doctor, by God. For many years he has been a leading surgeon in Wichita, and thousands call his name blessed. Perhaps that slip of the vaulting pole was not without its compensations.</p>
        <p>The accident put me permanently out of athletics, which was a good thing, too. My heart had enlarged so much that it had sprung the ribs outward, and the violent athletics made it verse. If there had been any medical examination required for entry I would never have been permitted to compete.</p>
        <p>When I approached the bar, pole poised for the vault, I invariably worked up such furious heart action that the scene went black as I left the ground, and the rest was automatic reaction. I could not hear the yelling of my schoolmates, so loud was the pounding of my pulse. The whole
        <pb n="36" />athletic episode, as it appears in mature review, was dangerous foolishness.</p>
        <p>I was out of school during two weeks of recuperation at home, Mother took me to Dr. B. S. Hamilton, leading nose man of the town, but she could not see her way to paying the fee he asked for clearing out the nasal passages. The medical loan said there were growths that retarded proper breathing, a thickening of the septum resulting from constant colds of boyhood on the farm, and other obstructions. He would undertake to do the necessary work over a period of weeks, spending about an hour on the job each time, until the nasal passages were clear. He asked a hundred dollars for the job.</p>
        <p>Mother sadly said there was no use talking about it. She would not go in debt to him for an amount that she could never pay.</p>
        <p>Hamilton was a notorious haggler about fees. He bargained like an old clothes man, and finally agreed to do it for thirty-five dollars, which Mother said she would promise to come by somehow.</p>
        <p>I had weekly appointments with the hose doctor for more than two months during the next school term. They were gruelling [sic], painful hours, and each one was followed by at least two considerable hemorrhages. I continued to wait table at Miss Cook's boarding house, and my kindly old maid employer showed concern for my vanishing health. I grew thinner and paler, and it was difficult to keep awake while studying.</p>
        <p>It was a cold winter, as Kansas winters know how to be cold. My roommate and I could not keep the drinking water from freezing in the pitcher while we slept. We took turns studying in bed, with quilts wrapped above the ears. On bitter evenings of blizzard, when the north wind drove snow and sleet through loose window frames, we often walked five blocks to the Manhattan hotel, at Douglas and Topeka avenues, and sat in the lobby as long as the management would permit, doing our lessons for tomorrow. It was pleasant there, in big, leather-covered,
        <pb n="37" />horsehair-stuffed lobby chairs, with fairly good light until about midnight, and regular steam heat. I retain today a warm spot in my heart for that old hostel and for the considerate night clerks who never spoke harshly to us because of our shameless intrusions. It came my way, years later, to do the house a favor, and it was done with theoverflowing gratitude of one who was cold when they took him in.</p>
        <p>During the bitterest part of the winter Poston and I bought a kerosene heater, commonly known as an oil stove. This was a futile and dangerous contraption, consisting of a large wick, burning kerosene from a bowl containing about a quart of fluid. A small barrel-like cylinder of enameled tin acted as radiator.</p>
        <p>The heat given off by this devilish instrument scarcely made an impression on the frost on the windows. It swelled up the room, consumed oxygen, and had to be regulated constantly to keep it from smoking.</p>
        <p>One evening, when the temperature in the room was zero, we lighted the stove and departed for our study in the Manhattan lobby. The room might be warm enough to undress in when we returned.</p>
        <p>After three hours of study we entered our poor little room, having noted that somebody had opened the windows wide. We were met by our landlady, weeping hysterically. The oil stove had gone bad for lack of tending or oxygen, and had given off a cloud of oily carbon, which had covered all the walls, windows, furniture, books, papersï¿½every inch of exposed surface.</p>
        <p>It took a month of work by Mrs. Leonard, assisted by both her roomers in spare time, to clean the mess. Walls, ceiling and floor had to be gone over, inch by inch, with cloths, to gather up the greasy soot. Every item in the room likewise. We went to school with books that blackened our hands, clothing and faces. Our kind, overworked, high-strung landlady never blamed us for the disaster. She wept because none of us could afford to keep warm.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="38" />Although Poston did not have to wait table or perform any other menial service, I always thought he was doing a more complete job than I, because he could have had so much better accommodations if he had been willing to ask his rich great-uncle for more money. Callahan was the son of well-to-do ranch people in Sumner county, some distance south of us. He played on the baseball team for a while, but soon tired of it. He said that his home town team at Calista, a cow village, had much more spirit than the city teams.</p>
        <p>He took pride in reciting to us the superior feats of the Calista team, always pronouncing it Calisty. He told how the boys took over the village on a Sunday afternoon, drinking beer and giving the team yell:Calisty oncet!</p>
        <p>Calisty twict!</p>
        <p>Holy jumpin' Jesus Christ! Do we play ball?</p>
        <p>Well, I should smile!</p>
        <p>We've been at it a hell of a while! The rest of us, not nearly so well dressed as Bill, clung to city life as far superior to the wild night life of Calista, We offered arguments, but he said, "Hell, this is a hick town and a hick school! As soon as I can I'm going to Kansas City, raise hell, and study medicine."Most of the boys did some work to help out with expenses, and some were poorer than I. We wore rubber or paper collars, washing them nightly with soap and water. Two rubber collars took me through all of my schooling. When Poston and I were discussing whether our collars would hold out through the next semester, Callahan ventured the irrelevant information, "I've got too damn many collars."There were other boys who were comparatively well-to-do. The Hamilton brothers, Lynn and Gail, known as Hammy and Eggie, came from a wheat ranch
        <pb n="39" />near Goddard, wore peg-top pants and loudly striped long coats, were always clean and neat, and gave forth an aura of respectable prosperity. Hammie became a wealthy broker in Chicago before he passed from my periphery, while Eggie took over the paternal acres and drove a Cadillac.</p>
        <p>Hiram Lewis, of our class, was the slight, red-haired son of one of the founders and supporters of the Academy, for whom the institution had been named. He lived in the finest old red brick house in town, in an atmosphere of comfortable prosperity. His brothers and sisters in a long line had graduated from Lewis, and his little sister Katherine was in one of the lower classes.</p>
        <p>Hiram was in our crowd of devilment-seekers and scrappers, though he was younger than most of us, and not notably strong. He was the business man of the class, taking over all treasurer jobs, financial arrangements for parties and celebrations, picnics and publications. He generally managed to make a little pocket money for himself out ofthese enterprises, and never hesitated to show the cash to the rest of us and attempt to teach us that it was better to handle the money than do the work.</p>
        <p>The Lewises had cultured manners, went to dancing school at the right age, attended and supported the First Presbyterian church, wore good but inconspicuous clothes, and all of them, except Hiram, studied hard. Hiram didn't bother about study, but got along. He had a slight speech impediment, which disappeared in the course of years, and his face had an embarrassing tendency to acne. These handicaps were good for Hiram. I believe they helped make him a democratic, unsnooty rich boy, where so many with his advantages might have become snobs.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="We all knew about Hiram's career. It was laid out for him. None of us was surprised, in visiting the home town in later years, to find" />
        <pb n="40" />Hiram conservatively heading the bank and investment business started by his father. Sweet little Katherine is now the wife of a former newspaperman, who became secretary (and a good secretary) of the Kansas State Historical Society, Kirke Meachem. Glade Eberly was the brightest member of our class. He was a short, stocky, broad-shouldered farm boy, about my age, with black hair, brown eyes, and a cultivated bashful manner that caught on with the girls. We judged that his people were what we called well off. Glade didn't have to work, and wore unpatched clothed that were sometimes almost up to our Hamilton standard of city sophistication.</p>
        <p>Glade and I were the only Greek students. Miss Laura Peterson, who taught this individualized class, put as much labor, conscientious guidance and seasoned scholarship into the job as if she were teaching forty graduate students at Harvard. For three years we stayed with it, each year doing considerably more than the course required, because Eberly and I both loved it and Miss Peterson rejoiced in our appreciation of the great classics. I have never had more satisfaction out of any course, anywhere.</p>
        <p>I gave two hours a day to Greek study. Whatever tins Glade gave to any study was his secret. He liked to impress the students with the legend that he never studied. But, since he had hours daily on his hands when most of us were working for board, he found time to study behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>I was completely stricken by the demure smile and charming blue eyes of the prettiest girl in our class, but was far too bashful and awkward to tell her so. The old obsession about having the odor of farmyard manure on my shoes held me back. She was dainty, wondrously clean, I thought, and modest as a violet. She was a good student, though not notably brilliant. I dreamed of a time when I would have good clothes, a haircut and absolutely odorless shoes.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="41" />Relations between boys and girls at this very proper school were polite, gay, friendly, comradely, but never rowdy or objectionably familiar. A few students who craved other modes of social relations were discreet enough to seek them elsewhere and not bring them into the Academy life.</p>
        <p>As I advanced through the courses in school, so in the business of earning bread. I worked at a great many restaurants, but not because of being fired, now. While I found satisfaction in my first dish wiping job, as anyone may find in a job which he learns to excel, I did not get along too well with the dishwashers. They were derelicts of the streets, drunkards, dope fiends, dirty, slovenly; stones by the Builder rejected.</p>
        <p>A man and a woman washed dishes in scalding water on one side of a counter, shoving them through to me with lightning speed, talking almost cryptic English meanwhile, with foul vulgarisms and obscenities flowing as fast as the dishes. He was a toothless old fellow, scarred by many a broken beer bottle, unshaven, talking out of a corner of his mouth. She was worse, if such were possible. Broad of beam, with tremendous arm and leg muscles, black, dirty hair down in her face always, a coarse mustache on her upper lip, awkward but swift in movement, she kept pace with the old man in production and obscenity.</p>
        <p>I did my work silently. I soon learned the trick of looping one comer of the dishcloth around a finger of the left hand and pushing the scalding dish this way and that, so many strokes and no more, and setting the dish aside with the left hand while reaching for another with the right.</p>
        <p>The dishwashers bought numbers from a beady-eyed cripple every day, paying a dime for a selected number. It was to pay off handsomely the guesser who held the number corresponding with the last three digits of the national bank clearance total, as published in the paper next
        <pb n="42" />morning. All dishwashers and thousands of underdogs in other fields made this investment daily.</p>
        <p>Once Slutty, as the lady dishwasher was called, won the pot. There was the number in her hand, and there it was in the bank report of the morning paper. Slutty was so happy that she promised to throw a beer party for all hands, and Carp, the male washer, kissed her in excess of congratulatory joy.</p>
        <p>When the numbers boy came, he said he was sorry, but there had been a mistake. Somebody else had that same number, so all bets were off for today. The imaginary pot was more than a thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>In the excitement of the moment, I ventured my first advice to the underworld. I said, "That's a dirty deal. Why don't you get the copson them?"The contempt with which this was greeted was well expressed by Slutty"You stick to your books, Slim, and be god-damned."
        <pb n="43" /></p>

      <div type="chapter" n="VI">
        <p>There was an interlude of work at table-waiting in a restaurant with a noble front, on East Douglas avenue. Across the whole show window was an elaborately scrolled title: "House of Lords Cafe." The place had been started as an exclusive, high-priced eating house), similar to the Royal Cafe in which John used to eat in the halcyon days of his employment in the wholesale liquor house. The original owner had gone broke, because the town was not rich enough to support such an enterprise, and good eaters were satisfied with the more conservative, quiet, unpretentious atmosphere of the George Puls place, much closer to Main street and the center of activity.</p>
        <p>Like many a customer, I was lured by the grand exterior, and thought I would fare well indeed if I should get a job in this place. I was quickly employed for a two-hours-a-day service. The restaurant did not serve breakfast. My employer was the dirtiest, smelliest, most revolting Greek I have ever seen and smelled, and I have since been in many lands where Greeks cooked and handed out food.</p>
        <p>He was a notch higher in the social stratum than the Puls dishwasher, but it was easy to imagine that he had recently pulled out of such a job and was trying to make a restaurateur of himself on a shoestring. He wore no tie, and his shirt had not been washed, I guessed, since Bryan ran for president. His face was unwashed and unshaven. He smelled of stale garlic so badly that he even offended himself, and had to keep the front door open for ventilation.</p>
        <p>Prices were what you could get. There was a printed menu, left over from the good days of the former management, now dirty and greasy, with scrawled notations all over and prices so blotted that no customer could give you an argument.</p>
        <p>When a new customer entered and inquired about the price of a
        <pb n="44" />meal ticket, Popadopulos went mildly crazy. He told the customer that prices were quite reasonable, asked him to be seated and try out a sample meal for cash, and went into the kitchen screaming, wild with excitement. "A new customer, Chef! Here, take this money and get a good T-bone steak from the butcher shop! A good one, mind you! If you let that thief sell you a tough one, it's all up with you! And cook up some fresh potatoes, and give 'em the works! Here, you, run out and get some fresh vegetables, corn on the cob, everything! Make a hurry, you louse, and get this man a swell dinner! I've got to sell some meal tickets if you two are going to get paid on Saturday!"The chef and second cook would run to neighboring stores, cash in hand, since the Greek bad long worn out his credit. They would return and, in sullen silence, proceed to cook the grand meal for the gentleman. They gave him the only decent food in the house.</p>
        <p>The customer, pleased with the meal and only bewildered by the filth of the fawning proprietor, paid for a twenty-one meal ticket and departed. His goose was properly cooked. From that time on, when he arrived for a mealy the boss would rush to the kitchen and order the chef to send out the worst stuff in the house. "Use up that rotten sausage," he ordered. "This fool has paid in advance."More often than not, the new customer would fail in his noblest efforts to eat his twenty-one meals, for which he had paid a good price. Continued complaints met with silence on the part of the two waiters and cold insolence from the boss.</p>
        <p>The other waiter was some sort of wastrel from the Brooklyn Bridge area. He spoke a jargon that I had never heard before and was not to hear often until I came to live in New York. He might have been Irish originally, but was a fugitive from justice now, according to his confidences with me. He said he picked this place
        <pb n="41" />to work because nobody wou3d ever find it.</p>
        <p>I was fascinated by the chef, who never said a word unless he had to. Silence was imposed by a large red ulcer on each side of his mouth, where the lips opened. There were similar ulcers covering every square or circular inch of face, hands, arms, neck and chest. That was all I ever saw of him. Some of the ugly red ulcers had pus spots in their centers. I was mildly curious to know what effect these pus exudations from the palms of the hands might have on meat patties which the chef fashioned continually throughout the day for the old customersï¿½those who seemed determined to eat up their tickets.</p>
        <p>One day the waiter said to me, "We're getting up a poise to send the chef to Hot Springs. He's gotta go, and we'll all be better off when he's gone. Have yu got a quatah?"I said no, and asked what ailed the chef and why Hot Springs.</p>
        <p>"Why, he's got the ol' ral, don't yu know? Plain as day, an' we wantta get him outa here. Besides, he'll die any day.""What did you say he has?""The ol' ral, sure!""What is that?""God Amightty, boy, yu ain't that igerant, an' yu goin' to school an' all? Don't know what the ol' ral is? Well it ain't no good fer anyboddy, an' Christ knows that. It's the syph, you know about that?""No, but I'd like to know.""Jesus H. Christ, you're more igerant that a wop on a Bronx trolley! Syph is contagious as hell, an' they don't get it by eatin' in nice homes. Anyway, if yu ain't got a quatah, no use wastin' time with yu."Later, however, the waiter showed me the cubby-hole where he
        <pb n="46" />and the syphilitic chef were compelled to sleep together nightly. It was simply a dining alcove, curtained off with heavy canvas, and wholly without ventilation. As he opened the canvas flap to show me the filthy bed, the whiff nearly finished me. It was worse than the proprietor.</p>
        <p>I didn't go back to my job that night. I hunted for another.</p>
        <p>A new restaurant was starting away out east on Douglas avenue, near the Santa Fe tracks. It looked interesting, though plain; no fancy notions. It had been open only two or three days, so it looked clean. I applied, and was taken on at once.</p>
        <p>The proprietor, who sat at the raised cashier's cage, was a phlegmatic blond man of about forty. He did not wear a coat or necktie, and dressed, to put it conservatively, quite economically, but cleanly. He was a little on the fat side, with something of a paunch and a full face that looked tired. He had large eyes and heavy eyelashes, and his right eye was conspicuously covered by a cataract. He turned his head, as does a robin seeking a worm, when he talked with you. He spoke in a low tone, chewed the end of a pencil, and seemed always to be looking for some unforeseen happening or person. He looked out into Douglas avenue, toward the Santa Fe passenger station, when business was slow, which it was.</p>
        <p>The work was easy, because there were hardly any customers. The chief cook gave me the setup, as he saw it.</p>
        <p>"Don't never cross that guy in the blue shirt that hired you," he said, patronizingly. Students were known to all chefs as waiters who occasionally declared themselves and refused duty.</p>
        <p>"Always be mighty careful what you say to a one-eyed man," my advisor went on. "This guy is one-eyed, but he's a badman besides, done proved and published.</p>
        <p>"This guy is a nice one to work for, if you mind your manners.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="47" />But he's a badman, done proved and published, like I told you. He never got that there flour-paste complexion out on the range, where he used to be. He made a little stake before he happened into a bit of trouble, and he's just got to where he can put that dough to work for himself. Honest? Hell, he wouldn't take a knife away from a Kickapoo without payin' him for it.</p>
        <p>"No, he never got into any trouble about honesty. He's jest a mite too violent in expressin' his point of view sometimes, if you get the drift. "Now, I'm tellin' you, Sonny, don't never cross him nor put on any airs about book-larnin'."This sounded like old wives' gossip to me, since my new boss had never spoken an unnecessary word to me, and had retained a composure and dignity obviously born of independent living. I could well believe that his education had been in the saddle.</p>
        <p>On my third morning at the new restaurant, which was in the fifteen-cents class and had plain but durable furniture, our first customer, who entered as soon as the doors were opened, was a tall cowboy. At least he looked tall in his big white Stetson and high-heeled boots. He was the only breakfaster in the dining room that morning.</p>
        <p>I quickly removed my coat and tied on my clean white apron (a relief, I thought, after the dirty ones we had been forced to wear at the House of Lords). I stepped to the side of the lone customer, bent low, and called off the choices of food available for breakfast, as was customary at that time and place:"Steak, pork sausage, lamb chops, bacon and eggs, fried salt pork, or boiled mutton?'This was a fairly typical meat list for a breakfast costing fifteen cents. The waiter learned the menu by rote for each meal, and
        <pb n="48" />soon became expert at it.</p>
        <p>"Steak, and damned tough, but big," said my guest.</p>
        <p>I then went through the lists of choices for vegetables, eggs, cereals and beverages.</p>
        <p>Last of all, "Tea, coffee, or milk?""Coffee."As I turned to go toward the kitchen to give the order, the proprietor beckoned me from his high seat.</p>
        <p>"Tell that fellow to take off his hat," he said. It was a gentle voice, I reflected, so there would be no trouble.</p>
        <p>I stepped over to the guest and, in a low voice, said, "The proprietor asks that you remove your hat at the table. Rule of the house.""Tell him to go to hell," was the reply, and I could see that my patient was suffering from a large hangover, with added hair of the dog trouble.</p>
        <p>I avoided the proprietor's eye and went to the kitchen. I returned with coffee, bread, butter and water, first act in serving breakfast.</p>
        <p>As I set the coffee down* the tough cowboy glared at me*"I said I wanted tea," he almost whispered.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry I made a mistake, sir," I answered, and took the coffee back to the kitchen. When I put the tea on the table, the weird character started to rise, and then settled in his chair, a malevolent eye upon me. "God damn it," he said, "I told you to get me coffee! Now do it, fast!""Certainly, sir," I replied. This time, as I turned toward the kitchen, I heard the Master's voice, low but vibrant. I went to his cage.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="49" />"What's the matter over there? he asked, quietly.</p>
        <p>"He has sent me for coffee and then tea and then coffee," I said, and he refuses to remove his hat,""Take the cup of stuff over and set it down beside him," said the affable boss. "Then just step aside, please. I'll take care of this boy."I did as directed. As the customer started to rebuke me, the proprietor was at his side, a large pistol in his right hand. With his left hand he knocked the breakfaster's big hat halfway across the room, and then, in a quiet tone, said, "Drink that stuff, Goddamn you, and drink it fast! You don't carry on that kind of business with my waiters,"The cowboy hesitated a brief moment. Then he started to rise, at the same time moving his right hand backward, toward the hip pocket. That hair of the dog had him confused.</p>
        <p>A bullet went through his head at close range. The foolish-looking cowboy toppled upon the table, which went crashing to the floor with him, making a great clatter of dishes.</p>
        <p>The suave proprietor walked back to his desk and put away the weapon. I said, excitedly, "Thanks for backing me up, sir, butï¿½"He said, calmly and kindly, "We won't be servin' no more breakfasts here this mornin', son. You kin go along to school if you want to,"Again, out of a job!</p>
        <p>It was often difficult for student waiters and the regular or professional waiters to understand each other's ways and points of view. But it was my observation that the regulars generally respected the students if the latter were skilled at their work, clean, and willing to carry their share of the load. Indeed, sometimes one became very friendly with the regulars with whom one worked
        <pb n="50" />daily for a long time.</p>
        <p>I remember a stretch at a restaurant on West Douglas avenue only because the cook rebuked another student and me who were, in the slack portion of the day, hearing each other's Latin declensions,"None uh dat foreign gab in here, kids; you hear me? We don't go fer enny foreign truck,"The man at the range is boss in the kitchen. We observed his orders strictly.</p>
        <p>At the same restaurant an incident happened that further enlightened me as to the irresponsibility of the itinerant professional waiter. We had one who had waited tables in many cities, and often regaled me with talk of wondrous scenes. He was a gay, high-strung fellow, fast on his feet, but inclined to come back with a hangover after his day off.</p>
        <p>The proprietor rebuked him one day, and said that if he ever came in again with liquor on his breath he would be fired.</p>
        <p>Sam, as he was known, took the lecture without a word. He was silent during the first part of the heavy luncheon. Then he said to me, "If you want to have fun, Slim, be at Table Four when I go to wait on the old dame that just set down. She is the richest gal that comes in here regular, and a great pet of the boss, you know." Yes, indeed, I knew. We student waiters were not permitted to take her order, but only to bring and arrange her setup. I carried out the hardware, water and butter, and was arranging them when Sam stepped up, smiling politely, and began to rattle off the menu.</p>
        <p>But such a menu! It rhymed awkwardly, and had a regular waiter's cadence. It was composed of the foulest obscenities in the patois of the underworld, none printable. Sam recited it
        <pb n="51" />in his ordinary dulcet tone, very rapidly, smiling.</p>
        <p>The grand lady caught her breath as if she had been struck by a tornado, and said, incredulously, "I didn't understand." Sam repeated the lingo, more slowly. The star customer rose shakily and almost ran out of the place.</p>
        <p>Sam winked at me happily, walked to the rear at his usual swift pace, removed his apron, put on his hat and coat, slapped me on the back in a comradely way, and vanished.</p>
        <p>__________Sometimes Big Flurry came to this restaurant for breakfast, because it was on his way home after he had disposed of his produce, in spring and summer. I always waited on him. His appetite and teeth were as good as ever. After having been up and working since four in the morning, he could devour four thick strips of bacon with a great heap of home-fry potatoes, extra helpings of green beans, peas, turnips and one other vegetable, varying from day to day. Two cups of coffee, with several slices of bread and butter, and the giant farmer was satisfied.</p>
        <p>He was growing old, without a doubt. He had been stooped in the shoulders since I had first known him, but was far more stooped now.</p>
        <p>To my inquiries he answered that he was well, thank God, but had many pains in his joints. He feared he would have to sell his farm and move to town. Pat Whaley already was looking out a desirable place for him, down on the Santa Fe tracks. He inquired about my health, admonished me against working too hard, and departed with a "God spare you, child!"During summers spent on the farm, while going to school in winter, I took up my old duties of marketing. Always there were summer apples, peaches, blackberries, and sometimes watermelons, 
        <pb n="52" />canteloupes [sic] and potatoes to sell. The early morning trips and the gruelling [sic] job of selling the produce in a glutted market were easier now. I was personally known to most of the buyers, who had seen me growing up from early childhood, when the heavy watermelons were almost too much for me to handle. They knew of my venture into the realm of slightly higher learning. Many of them had sons or daughters in the same school,My first greengrocer friend, Billy Dye, had quit the business and gone in for manufacture of a special chile con carne mixture, which was slowly building a fortune for him. I stopped by to visit with him at his office. He took a brotherly interest in my school work, clipped everything that was printed in the papers about the oratorical contests and athletic meets, and subscribed for the Lewis Academy News, besides running a perpetual advertisement in it.</p>
        <p>I parked my wagon outside the grocery store of Charlie Fuller, a hard-working men, blind in one eye, who had bought my goods first because he was sorry for me, and now because ha was glad he had done so in the beginning. One advantage of a small town is the natural growth of friendships based upon mutual respect.</p>
        <p>When I was employed as a waiter at Miss Cook's I had just about reached the summit of student waiter ambition. There were a few better boarding houses in town, but this one held high estimation among student waiters, not more than two of whom were employed there at any one time.</p>
        <p>It was a rambling old house, to which additions had been made from time to time. The dining room could seat forty, and was always filled at rush hours. The usual three hours were required of me, and the overtime, not paid for, nearly always amounted to an hour a day. You simply couldn't leave while tables
        <pb n="53" />were crowded. It wouldn't be fair to the two girls who were the only regular waiters.</p>
        <p>They were nice girls. One was a strong, muscular, fast-stepping lady, cross-eyed, affable, wholly uneducated, friendly with everybody and frequently asking the students for advice on pronunciation, letterï¿½writing and medicine. The other was a delicate, well-mannered blonde from a small town, who was a protege of Miss Cook's, and probably working here during an interlude in her life or romance. I took a short-lived fancy to her, and corresponded with her for months after she went back to her home in Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Profanity and vulgar language were strictly prohibited in this house. But it is difficult to keep some kitchen help in line under such rules.</p>
        <p>The chef was a sweet lady of great girth, middle age, phenomenal endurance, and competent skill. She was a devout Catholic, attended Mass every morning before taking her breakfast station between the long coal range and the serving counter.</p>
        <p>There was a second cook, a woman of forty, strong and competent, who would take no nonsense from anybody, and a third cook who changed in identity from time to time.</p>
        <p>Two dishwashers, a potato peeler and a vegetable man, with helpers in the menial Jobs, completed the kitchen army.</p>
        <p>One of the potato peelers had the extra duty of handling comebacks, sorting the edible and the inedible, and disposing of slips. He was a rather objectionable individual, and quarrelsome. He was lifting a dish pan half full of slop one day when the second cook made a pleasant remark, and he talked back, using a word not permitted in any polite society.</p>
        <p>The second cook swished a wet dishcloth across his face, and
        <pb n="54" />dived over the serving counter at him. She had lost control of herself completely. The potato peeler, known simply as Peeler, started to run. There was no escape except by way of the dining room, which was crowded with diners.</p>
        <p>After him, through the swinging door, went the second cook, her skirt tucked up, face distorted with wrath, carrying in front of her the pan of slop. She was shouting imprecations, but decent ones, at the fear-stricken Peeler. At strategic intervals she gained upon him and came close enough to discharge the odoriferous swill in torrents upon his bald head. Naturally, some of this semi-liquid stuff splashed upon the diners and their food.</p>
        <p>The screaming Second pursued Peeler through the maze of tables and chairs, through the parlor, and out the front door on to the porch. She skimmed the dishpan at him as he stumbled down the front steps, and caught him a sharp clip in the small of the back.</p>
        <p>The peeler never returned for his coat and hat.</p>
        <p>Miss Cook emerged from her office, off the dining room, as Second returned, weeping, from her mad pursuit.</p>
        <p>White as her best tablecloth, the proprietor confronted Second. She did not utter a word. Second, addressing her employer and the diners at once, said, in a loud voice, between hysterical sobs: "He thought we wasn't ladies because we work in the kitchen. I let him know, God damn him!"Miss Cook went about among the diners, asking that they permit her to have their clothing cleaned or replaced at her expanse. None accepted the offer, as they knew she was not to blame. She had fresh food brought to those who might have suffered damage to dinners. She did not speak to the second cook until that lady had quieted down and had donned her street clothes. Then she said, "You did right, Mary, but please don't do it again. Go home and rest, and
        <pb n="55" />be back on time tomorrow."Miss Cook's character was compounded of good will, gentleness, and a keen business sense. She made a fine income, and her charity was so personal and genuine that her memory is revered by many who were her boarders and employees. At her passing, in advanced age, she left little but love.</p>
        <p>From the first, I had felt that table-waiting, dishwashing, and the other servile tasks to which I set myself were as important to my education as any reading of the noble passages of the Anabasis or the windy political speeches of Cicero. I considered it a privilege, denied only to the rich boys, to work for such people as Miss Cook, and to serve her boarders as well as I could.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="VII">
        <p>Not always did fair weather dominate the scene for me at school, and the news from home was not persistently sunny.</p>
        <p>Chorus was one of the jokes of the wild boys from the farms, especially since we did not admire the instructor. He wore his blond hair long and slicked back. He also wore a gold pince-nez, end, on dress occasions, a locket watch pinned on the outside of his coat with a fleur-de-lys gold pin. He usually wore a dark cutaway coat, and he spoke with a slight lisp. I have no doubt that he was a fine young man, and I afterwards learned that he was held in high regard as a music teacher. But we boys did not like him.</p>
        <p>Chorus seemed non-essential to us anyway. It met once a week, and that was an hour of boisterous fun. When the master had got the girls started on "Old Black Joe," the boys, led by me, off-key, would start singing the Academy song, the "Star-Spangled Banner", or some other popular thing. Sometimes the girls would join us, and the piano would be completely ignored.</p>
        <p>This was a case for severe discipline, but the school's weakest point was discipline. Year by year, bending to the inevitable trend, this school was losing financial strength. It needed the tuition of every student. Expulsion meant that the pupil's parents were relieved of expense, and the expelled one could go to a free high school.</p>
        <p>The master abandoned the chorus, much to his humiliation before the rest of the faculty. Since chorus was not required for graduation, nobody minded it a bit. French was another unruly class. Poston and I were the only ones requesting French, but there had to be six in order to justify starting the class. We approached several girls, asking them to 
        <pb n="57" />keep us company in the class, and promising fun. Twenty girls joined.</p>
        <p>Poston and I studied and did creditable work, because we liked the subject. With one or two exceptions, the girls did not know a verb from a horse in French, and were not interested in finding out.</p>
        <p>The teacher was a young and awkward lady, just out of college, who knew nothing about handling pupils. We enjoyed making life miserable for her. Horseplay kept the class in thunderstorms of laughter when it should have been giving serious attention to irregular verbs.</p>
        <p>At the end of the semester, our instructor flunked the whole class, though that meant a black eye for her. She could not take that kind of beating any longer.</p>
        <p>Poston and I protested the flunk, demanded our papers, proved that the grades had been rigged, and appealed, with evidence, to the Principal. The lady was compelled to continue the French class, with only two students.</p>
        <p>Horseplay ceased, no girls being present. We had a successful semester, made more than average progress, and went on with the subject the next year. In fact, I spent many a dime that I should have brought home from marketing, for the purchase of French books at the Rock Island Book Store. These I read and studied in the shade of the cottonwood grove when I should have been cultivating corn.</p>
        <p>Van had come home from school again in the middle of a semester, obviously seriously afflicted with nervous exhaustion approaching complete prostration. His new doctor prescribed bromidia. Van had been taking it for six months, reporting much relief, when I heard about it and sounded an alarm.</p>
        <p>"Don't you knew [sic] that stuff is habit-forming?""No. Nobody told me anything like that. The druggist just
        <pb n="58" />fills the prescription every time I ask for it, I can sleep, and when I get wild I take a teaspoonful and I'm all right."I dug up literature on the subject. Van was frightened, as was Mother.</p>
        <p>"Habit?" said Van. "I'll show you!"He quit the bromidia with half a bottle left on the shelf, never took it again, and gradually showed signs of returning normality. But his phobias beset him, and many of the neighbors considered him both lazy and crazy.</p>
        <p>Tom Monckton, an Irish farmer who was rearing his numerous family on a desolate farm among the gypsum hills, came with his wagonload of brood to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Monckton had some sort of voice defect. He talked in a high note, which still could not be called soprano. It was something like the tone you might get out of a soprano horn if you poured sand and broken glass into it. At top pitch, the voice cracked in a weird manner. Tom was the salt of the earth, but life had not given him a notable break.</p>
        <p>Domestic affairs were freely discussed between the two families. It was obvious that Monckton, whom Big Flurry always had called Squalor (meaning Squealer) had no respect for this modern American foible, education.</p>
        <p>Van listened, fidgeting, as his case was discussed from all angles. He answered questions as quietly as possible, making it clear that he was not interested in any verdict that this jury might, bring in.</p>
        <p>"A lawyer he wants to be?" squealed old Tom. "Sure an' God bless me soul, if he wants to be a lawyer, let him kape away from colleges. Maybe ï¿½tis thrue, as he says, that this Creighton is run by Jesuits an' all, but the Jesuits are presuming lads. They thinks they knows
        <pb n="59" />it all, God forgive me for telling the thruth on them.</p>
        <p>"Florence, me bye (using Van's real given name), take yer book an' sit down, an' you can learn all the law there is. What do the Jesuits know about law, only the law of God that they should be preaching, instead of getting all puffed with pride in their big colleges.</p>
        <p>"Take yer book an' sit down, bye, an' don't that you do be wasting all the money they can dig out of these acres."Van had left before the verdict was finished. He classed Monckton with the hospital priest who had told him to stick to his groove. From the day of the Monckton visitation, Van, despite his weakness and agitation, was determined to go to Creighton law school. He started corresponding concerning admission.</p>
        <p>The Moncktons looked upon our farm and agricultural setup as so fortunate that we should be far ahead of the point we had reached, financially. This was good land, rich, low, able to withstand total drought for a month, if there were no hot winds. The Monckton highland, of poor quality, produced but sorry crops, even in good years. Yet the hard-bitten pair, industrious husband and patient wife, had reared or were rearing an enormous family of red-haired children. Some of the daughters were pretty, but all had to work in the arid fields.</p>
        <p>Barelegged and barefooted, the youngest girl, a mare child, followed a harrow over dry fields, driving a team of strong horses, enveloped in a stifling cloud of dust, from sunup to sundown. She was a laughing, happy girl, and took for granted the necessity to lend a strong young hand in this perpetual battle against the elements and the ungenerous soil of her father's upland acres.</p>
        <p>Boys and girls and mother, and the gray-haired head of the house, fought together, year after year, the spectres of drought, soil
        <pb n="60." />erosion, and the thousand ills to which the flesh of farm beasts is heir. They never won a battle, but they ate, enjoyed their few pleasures keenly, and did no man wrong; neither was guile found in their mouths, Tom Monckton thought he was giving out wisdom to a good family that had strayed from the path of Irish tradition when he said, "Take your book an' sit down."When I asked Van where he supposed the folks were going to get the money to send him to law school, he replied, "I don't care how or where they get it. I'm going to law school, I have worked like a slave on this damned farm since I was able to walk, and got nothing. Now I'm going to get an education and not worry about where it's coming from."(The folks was the expression we always usï¿½d in referring to all the rest of the family or any multiple thereof,)I argued: "Are you too good to work your way, as I do?" The answer was pat: "You're three years younger than I am, and, according to schedule, not entitled to any schooling at all until you're about fifty. Yes, you've got the guts to go out and work while you go to school. A hell of an education you'll get that way. I have to study, and I want to go where they require study. Law is no sleigh-ride, like a Protestant hymn book. You know all the hymns, but your Latin is pig-Latin, and a good Catholic pig wouldn't even listen to it."I said, "What's the matter with your guts?"Again the typical Van answer: "What's the matter with your brains?"I often wondered. Already, we were drawing away rapidly from the neighborhood in which we grew up, from the neighbors, who could not understand why a farm should be depleted to furnish big-bug education to its sons.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="61" />More and more seldom did neighbors come to call. The family, or what was left of it, had moved into another world. The neighbors who used to come with banjos and guitars, French harps and Jews' harps, accordions and fiddles, to sing and play the evening away, now held themselves in polite reserve. The Driscolls were not only Dam Ole Kafflicks, but they had gone high-hat, with two boys talking Latin and Greek to the cattle whenever they came home in slicker clothes. All of this was a matter of total indifference to Van and me, since we had other interests that completely blotted out the old Valley associations. We never had been close to the people who had chased us with sticks and clods, poked ridicule at us, and taunted us for our "idolatry." We had found civilization, and would be content if we could make ourselves worthy of it.</p>
        <p>As to John and Mother, they were close companions, sympathetic and understanding. John, hair now graying above the ears, was a spoiled boy. He knew how much Mother depended upon him for conversation and inward thinking. For no apparent reason, he would fall into a pout. Mother was mystified by these strange interludes, when John spoke to no one, ate with eyes upon his plate, and went to bed without saying goodnight.</p>
        <p>Mother often discussed this matter of the melancholy seizures of John with me, "Sometimes he won't speak to me for days," she said, "and I have no idea what's the matter with him. We haven't had any quarrel. It seems that he just wants me to ask him to forgive me for something I don't know anything about,"With the wisdom of a first-year psychology student, I said, "He just needs a wife. And God help the girl! But they're all too smart to marry him. Why does he quarrel with every girl he goes out with? Because they won't worship him the way you do.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="62" />but his mother, and you can't escape blame for that. But he'll never marry, because a woman with half a brain knows a little bit about men. I don't know about girls, but I do play up to them, and am mighty thankful when they pay any attention to me. John wants to sit on a throne and let the girl make a fuss over him. He's not that good.""John is a good boy and a good son, but sometimes he puzzles me," said Mother, thoughtfully.</p>
        <p>Mother no longer picked berries or gathered windfall apples from under the trees, as she had done a few years earlier. John had allowed the berry acres to be overrun with locust seedlings from the black locust grove that Dad had planted to hold the sand along the west border. It was now impossible to get into the berry patches without a corn knife to chop your way. Sometimes John would go to the south rim of the berry area, in midsummer, and pick all he could eat off the vines. Then ha would pick half a hatful and bring them in to Mother, who would fix up two large dishes of blackberries and cream for the two of then. That was all that was left of the berry business, which for a generation had kept the large family in clothes, and often far more.</p>
        <p>The locusts, which we appropriately called the Plague of Locusts, also had spread into the peach orchard, and, together with peach seedlings and the native brush, were making it more difficult, from season to season, to get in where peaches were still ripening.</p>
        <p>In our growing detachment from farm worries, Van and I considered John's lackadaisical methods extremely amusing. We called the impenetrable thicket the Deep-Tangled Wildwood, and I composed legends about lost tribes of horses and wild hogs that roamed its depths.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="63" />John now sold the apple crop on the trees and the alfalfa crop standing. There was no lack of buyers, who invested labor and the purchase price and made good profits. The low fields at the back of the farm, John said, were never worth farming. Mostly, they produced weeds now.</p>
        <p>As I went back to school for another glorious fling at the job of learning how to learn, Van, eager, excited, thin, irritable and dreamy, was reading college catalogs. He did not think he would have to go back to the St. Benedict's gravy to graduate in order to be admitted to a good law school. He had no fear of entrance examinations.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="VIII">
        <p>George Knappenberger was one of the most earnest students among the upperclassmen at the Academy. He was thin, wiry, self-sufficient. He wore poor clothes, and obviously came from a poor family, somewhere on the high plains of the Kansas cow country. Everybody liked him| but few knew him intimately. Once, when he went home for Christmas, I stoked his furnaces for him. He had built up a route on which he fed coal to the furnaces night and morning, and sometimes, in cold weather, dropped in at noon to shake up the fire.</p>
        <p>On an afternoon George took on Glade Eberly, at the suggestion of our Latin professor, Marion Smith, for a wrestling match, in the schoolyard. Glade won easily, and George came out with a badly torn suit of cheap brown cotton clothes.</p>
        <p>Smith was conscience-stricken. He made a joke of it, but privately mentioned to the other boys that George could not afford to lose a suit to amuse us, and passed a hat. Some contributed, some could not. Smith put in an amount no one saw, and George got a new suit.</p>
        <p>George confided to me that he was going to be a surgeon. Not merely that he wanted to be or hoped to be. It was a matter that was altogether settled.</p>
        <p>Gosh, I wanted to be a doctor too, but I couldn't afford it! There was no other course that cost so much. The nearest school was in the University of Kansas, at Lawrence. Yes, George was going there. But, I argued, he would starve to death. "Not to death," said George, smiling grimly.</p>
        <p>Lawrence was a small town. The older students had all the paper routes, lawn mowing, furnace tending, tied up. What chance would a freshman have?</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="65" />George, who would graduate from the Academy next spring, said he had all that arranged. He had been working on it for three years. He had jobs enough to keep him eating and to pay fees, but it would be a squeak, and a hell of a long one. I had conceived the ambition of becoming a writing doctor. There was no such thing in those days, so far as I knew, but I liked to write and I longed to be a doctor. Why not combine the two, doctor and writer? But the expenses were terrific. I must find a college, if I could go to college, where I could work for all or nearly all of my expenses. Van would require whatever the folks could raise.</p>
        <p>Dr. George Knappenberger became a leading surgeon of a Western city. Thousands made tracks to his door for specialized treatment. Sons say you can pick ï¿½em in prep school. George died, full of honor, in California, a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Although I longed to be a writing doctor, I had little hope for accomplishment of that ambition. I had settled down to the intention of preparing to teach languages in Kansas high schools. Other vistas loomed dimly. I worked hard at languages, read up on colleges that specialized in modern or ancient languages, and waited on the customers with gaze focused far ahead.</p>
        <p>Miss Cook had a friend, another old maid, named Maggie Parker. She was from some other state, and put on airs, as we waiters used to size her up. She was not at all good-looking, but had her hair done by an expert, wore rouge and carried herself with the haughty air of a Sussex lady, she affected an accent of no particular locale. She was a queen without throne, and did not mix with social activities of the house.</p>
        <p>Miss Parker occupied a room next to Miss Cook's, but did not appear for the evening hour around the grand piano in the
        <pb n="66" />parlor. There were two old maids who played and sang well. They liked to lead the evening festivities. There was a young bachelor lawyer, George McGill, who had a good voice, a winning personality, and was known to be ambitious for a career, though he was poor and unknown outside of that boarding house. He moved up to the piano, and the others who were likewise unattached and lonely, moved up.</p>
        <p>They sang "I Love You Only," "Beautiful Lady," "Goodnight Ladies," and one and another of the haunting airs from "Chocolate Soldier," and the other light operas that inspired men to propose marriage to women in those days. Victor Herbert was standard singing material, and our pianist knew him by heart. There was less enthusiasm for Gilbert and Sullivan, though it was my privilege to hear several numbers from "Pirates of Penzance" and "Pinafore."At Miss Cook's there was no noticeable social distinction between the student waiter and the boarders. I could have joined the happy throng, except for two factors. I was bashful, painfully aware of my poor clothes and the hog-pen odor of my shoes, and I couldn't sing. But when I had time, or rain was falling so heavily that I could not get to my room easily, I sat in the background and drank in the music. The freedom and gusto with which the young men and young women, some not so young, sang to each other about love and romance moved me deeply. Here was a phase of life I had not known. Obviously, there was much enjoyment to be had in it. I thought how I would like to enter into the healthy romance of the evening, and walked the mile to my room, stirred by a vague unhappiness. Perhaps, after all, education was not thesummum bonum vitae. I buried myself in Horace, whom I was reading for a possible college credit.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="67" />By working Saturday afternoons and nights at Goldsmith's book store, and later in the shoe department of the Boston Store, I saved enough money to buy a Society Brand suit of the latest style. It was conservative in color, extreme in cut. Peg-top trousers with deep cuffs, and long, loose, double-breasted coat, with pearl buttons, deep and wide lapels.</p>
        <p>John laughed tolerantly at my eccentric dress. He said that gentlemen did not wear cuffs on their pants, but on their shirts, and the only proper cuffs were of hard starched white linen, held by metal cuff-holders to the shirtsleeve.</p>
        <p>Link cuff buttons were proper, as was a hard standup collar with wings, an Ascot tie being preferable even to a well-tied four-in-hand. Ties must be conservative in shade, and John was shocked by a red and blue one I bought for a quarter. But John's authority was fading. I paid more attention to Hammy and Eggy Hamilton, who seemed to win friends and influence people more readily than John did.</p>
        <p>I wore my Society Brand suit, which had a permanent crease sewn down the front of the baggy trouser lags, to Church, to any social events I was able to attend, and to visit Mother on the farm on special occasions. Of course, in oratorical contests, outside our own school.</p>
        <p>Marie approved of the citified getup, and said she believed Charlie was going to fit into some sort of city job. She was all for it, having seen too much of the endless struggle with the unyielding soil.</p>
        <p>My stories of the big city and the interesting people I met were a source of wonder and delight at home, especially when Marie was visiting. George McGill had been nominated for county attorney, and if he should be sleeted he was going to drive across the hills
        <pb n="68" />to Western Kansas in an automobile and marry a girl whom he 'd promised to marry if ever he amounted to anything. Of course he would amount to a great deal, I told them how brilliant and pleasant a man was this boarder who acted toward me as though I were somebody, and asked me about my oratorical triumphs. What a person! The family agreed that he would go far.</p>
        <p>Non-chronological note: He became a famous and long-serving senator from Kansas.</p>
        <p>There was another boarder, known as the star boarder, whom I, among others, considered amusing, because we did not know. He was Mr. Doyle, known only thus, and as Miss Cook's friend. He had a room on the ground floor, adjoining Miss Cook's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle was a short, plump man, with a large head, bulging blue eyes, and scarlet face. It was obvious that he existed under some sort of extraordinary handicap, but none of us knew what it was. He did not go to an office or store; he did not work for a living.</p>
        <p>The table nearest the kitchen was known as Mr. Doyle's table, and it was my pleasant distinction to serve this table. Miss Cook ate there, opposite Mr. Doyle. The star boarder ate special food, prepared at his whim. All you had to say to the good- natured cook was, "Special order of ham and eggs with lightly fried eggs on top of the ham and potatoes fried in cream, Mr. Doyle."Mr. Doyle was well barbered and well dressed. A barber came to the house every morning to shave him. He wore a brown sack suit, well tailored. His toilet was immaculate.</p>
        <p>He spoke with a slight thickening of speech, sometimes more noticeable than at other times. We waiters ignorantly presumed that this circumstance and the scarlet complexion were attributable to alcohol.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="69" />Mr. Doyle was a sensitive man. He knew that his appearance caused comment and possibly amused some of the customers. He resented any such liberties, as indeed almost anyone in his position would.</p>
        <p>He was uncertain in his gait. He walked into the dining room from his room, usually at the height of the rush, staggered through the aisles of chairs, and took his seat at his table. Sometimes he missed the table and bumped his head against the door jamb, several feet distant. On such occasions he looked for insult.</p>
        <p>If he saw diners laughing, at the next table, he leaned over belligerently and said, "Were you laughing at me?"The question became so commonly known that it was lightly regarded. The boarders usually answered politely, "No, Mr. Doyle, but my friend here is awfully funny."Sometimes, in a rush meal, one or two boarders sat opposite Miss Cook and Mr. Doyle. By chance, they might be strangers. At some time during the meal, Mr. Doyle was sure to lean forward and issue a challenge, "What are you staring at me for?"In such cases Miss Cook soothed the star boarder and asked the customers to consider that nothing had been said. That saintly lady had her hands full, besides running a profitable boarding house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle had the run of the place. The old boarders understood something of his case, and a few knew the story, which I eventually heard from a close friend of Miss Cook. Within the memory of my informant, Mr. Doyle had been a handsome, witty, brilliant and successful traveling salesman, on good salary, and on his way up.</p>
        <p>He and Miss Cook were engaged to marry while both were still young and happy.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, he was stricken. He was long in a sanitarium, where his sweetheart visited him daily. The doctors told her that there
        <pb n="70" />never could be any marriage, but that Mr, Doyle might live a long time.</p>
        <p>She bought the house with her little fortune, inherited from her parents, started a boarding house, and took Mr. Doyle to the only home he would ever know. He never lacked for anythingï¿½except, possibly, health, clear vision, and a wife.</p>
        <p>He died several years after I had left the pleasant, service of Miss Cook. She sold the boarding house and went to Florida to live "gray remainder of the evening out."Miss Parker, after long consultation with her friend, Miss Cook, made me an offer. She said that Miss Cook had consented. Miss Parker had rented an old mansion, fully furnished, only a block or two away. She was going to open a class boarding house, with high-priced food. If I would work as her student waiter, I would have only two hours of serving, hours strictly maintained, and would get three good meals a day. She emphasized the qualitative adjective.</p>
        <p>I needed that extra hour, which might be an hour and a half, since I worked overtime at Miss Cook's. I talked with my employer. She said that I would be foolish to refuse the offer. She had talked it over with Miss Parker. I had developed into an expert waiter, and could earn good wages, said Miss Cook, if I were headed in that direction, which she knew I was not.</p>
        <p>Then I told her a story at which she smiled faintly. Her head waiter, a wild man from San Francisco, had offered to consult with me on my career, since he understood that I was not receiving wages.</p>
        <p>"You've got a big future ahead of you, Slim," he said. "You're a damn good waiter. Lots of 'em in the big towns ain't got nothing on you. Cut out this education stuff, and go and get the dough! You're wastin' your time studyin' Greek. True, there's a lot of Greeks runnin' eat joints in this country now, but they can all understand you when you ask for a job in English. Stick to English:
        <pb n="71" />the Greeks ain't so hot anyhow."This same waiter had regaled me with scenes from the San Francisco earthquake, of which, he said, he had been a victim.</p>
        <p>"I waded in blood up to my knees at the Ferry," he said. "I lost all my clothes, two trunks full. Pretty soon I'm goin' to shove some money into clothes and go on a tower. You gotta have clothes if you go on a tower. I've never been to New York, but if I hit that burg with plenty of clothes, I'll have a head-waiter job by Christmas. Take my advice, boy. You got talent. Don't waste it in school. You ought to see the kind of females you can get in the big towns if you got talent! I'm shovin' money into clothes an' goin' on a tower that will take me to New York."So, as the final year of my preparatory course loomed, I went to work at the exclusive boarding house of Queen Maggie.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="IX">
        <p>Directly ahead, Van and I saw dimly mother task, another opportunity. Whenever he could get up enough courage, he would start to law school. Credits were lined up already. I would go to college as soon as I had finished at Lewis, next year.</p>
        <p>We spent time talking things over that summer, as we never had before,"The Old Man wasn't so bad," said Van.</p>
        <p>"No, he'll do pretty well. But he's better when he's away, isn't he?""Well, he knows how to farm, and he's not lazy," said Van.</p>
        <p>We agreed that it was Big Flurry's tyrannies that annoyed us most, and we declared that if we had been as old as we were now we would not have put up with them. "I'd like to hear anybody, even the Father Director or the Abbot, tell me that I must eat more potatoes because they're cheaper than quinine."Yet, we reflected, a good deal of the Old Han's roaring was bluff. We had caught him petting Old Shep and other animals when he didn't know anybody was looking. And he had never whipped us but once, and then not severely. Mother whipped us hundreds of times, and we never thought of criticizing her for it, though the punishment was often for trivial causes, or what we considered no cause at all.</p>
        <p>Dad had made us work, and some of the work had been too severe for small boys, particularly when we had to walk all day through burning sand to toss sorghum seed into furrows. We had not dared to complain or refuse duty. Now we blamed ourselves. We should have gone to the Boss at the end of the row and said, "We can't stand this. It's too hot. You have shoes. Take them off and try it. If you can stand it for an hour, we'll try it again."
        <pb n="73." />Yes, undoubtedly the Irish tradition of the infallibility of Himself, Head of the House, often led to injustice and cruelty, much of it unintended.</p>
        <p>Van was one whose heart softened toward anybody who had done him wrong as soon as that person was absent, or once the grievance had ceased to be active. But he was wary of John.</p>
        <p>"We need a lawyer in this family," he said. "When I get my degree and am admitted to the bar, I'm going to fix up the situation here. The farm is in John's name, and Mother trusts him to divide up with the rest of us after she dies. He won't do it unless somebody forces him to. Already, while Mother is alive, he refers to it as his farm. We're fools if we let him get away with it."I went back to school, and one winter day I heard that Van had demanded and somehow got a certain amount of money, and had taken a train for Omaha. He was a student in Creighton University School of Law, and liked it.</p>
        <p>He had promised to get a job, waiting table. Mother had told him the farm could not support him in such an expensive school without help from him. Van used to tell of that waiter's job with loud laughter. It lasted a week. Then Van spilled soup down acustomer's back, and the diner, a fat lady, claimed he did it deliberately. The rough-and-tough landlady fired Van, who calmly pulled money from his pocket and bought a meal ticket.</p>
        <p>"I like the company here," he said, "though the food is terrible."He took a seat next to the lady whose back he had burned, and ate ravenously.</p>
        <p>He ate too much to suit the landlady, though he was paying for meals. One day the lady put six portions of meat on a platter for six customers. Van thought the portions too small, so he took two.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="74" />When the landlady came to the door she stood, arms akimbo, and surveyed the table.</p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ! Who ate all the meat?" she asked. Van said he would have another portion, please. She wouldn't sell him another ticket.</p>
        <p>Van never again waited table. The work was not for him, he said. Mother sent him money for board and room until he got a good job. He was secretary of the Democratic club in the law school. His activities drew the attention of local Democratic politicians. They gave him a part-time job, with board, lodging and sixteen dollars a month, as an assistant in the County Detention Home for Boys. He also worked at a small-pay job on the college paper. He was doing well in his studies.</p>
        <p>My job at Queen Maggie's was not much to my taste, but I stayed on because the food was a little better than Miss Cook's and the hours shorter. Miss Parker gave me a stern reminder when I was a minute late, but was fair about letting me go on time, too. She made a point of keeping me in my place, and did not encourage me to talk in a friendly way with the boarders, as Miss Cook had done. She told me not to sit in the parlor, even while waiting for a meal to be served. She said that those things were all right elsewhere, "but my clientele doesn't look with favor upon it."I could have walked out to a more agreeable job at any time, but I was beginning to take pride in adjusting myself to circumstances. Miss Parker dressed up and ladied around the place, seldom assisting with the work. She had fifteen regular boarders, and consorted in a friendly manner with only two.</p>
        <p>These were a pretentious lady who worked in some capacity at a department store, and the lady's girlish son, about eighteen 
        <pb n="75" />or nineteen, who did nothing. The lady dressed and talked in a highly affected manner, and one might think she ate at the Rita, the way she bossed that house around. Miss Parker usually ordered some special food for this pair. The girly boy would say, in lisping speech, that he didn't like some thing on the menu, and off it went. The cook had to provide a substitute, no matter how busy she was.</p>
        <p>One Sunday I was waiting on these special customers when the Little Lord said he wanted a soft-boiled egg, three minutes. It was the waiter's duty to order the egg, and, when it was delivered by the cook, to break it into a glass, provided for him on the serving table. I had done this a thousand times.</p>
        <p>Now, Miss Parker operated on a short dish and glassware inventory. She had rented the house with all furnishings, including dishes, and didn't want to buy anything. We were always having to wait until the dishwiper got a used dish to us before being able to carry out an order.</p>
        <p>In this case there could be no delay. I looked around for a glass, spied several dark ones on a sideboard. I took the first one, broke the egg, and served His Curly Lordship.</p>
        <p>In a moment I saw Miss Parker hurrying to the side of Lady Lovely and her pretty son. Horrified, I saw the young man, under Mama's direction, bring up from the egg a small steel nut, two needles, some pins, and an old brass ring.</p>
        <p>Maggie called me over, and in a low voice asked what. I could scarcely restrain a loud guffaw, so ludicrous was the situation.</p>
        <p>"Well, it's one of two things," I explained, nonchalantly, feeling sure that I was fired anyway. "There being no clean glasses in the kitchen, I took this one from the sideboard. Either it had
        <pb n="76" />all this junk in it, or else this is an ostrich egg."I took the glass to the kitchen and ordered another egg and a clean glass. Miss Maggie did not deign to speak to me as I took off my apron at the close of the meal. I went to a boarding house, the best by far in the town, on North Topeka avenue, run by three ladies named McCandless. Miss Fannie, the proprietor-in-chief, was pleased with my long experience-record. I named Miss Cook as reference. I stayed with this house until the end of my Academy course.</p>
        <p>Service here was home style. Doors of the two large dining rooms in the vast house, built by some feudal lord named Jocelyn as a home, were kept locked until the minute dinner or lunch was ready. Food was set out in large dishes, full and steaming when the doors were opened.</p>
        <p>The customers filed in until all places, about eighty, were filled. The others had to wait for second table, which usually was about half filled. On Sunday only one meal was served, but it was a wonder.</p>
        <p>Miss Fannie supervised, talked with the boarders, and took in the money. Miss Tom worked like a slave at the range, as chief cook. There was a third sister who was not always present, but worked at any job that needed a hand when she was there.</p>
        <p>The house was amazingly prosperous. There was a waiting list of persons who wanted to buy meal tickets,, which cost considerably more than those at other houses and restaurants. The ordinary run of restaurants charged two-twenty for a ticket of twenty- one meals. Miss Fannie charged five dollars. I was getting far more in food than I had got before this time, and worked only two hours a day.</p>
        <p>We had a high-grade clientele. The choice of dishes was so
        <pb n="77" />great that few customers ever asked for anything that was not on the table. Big dishes were passed around several times, to make sure that everyone was satisfied. Great bowls of the finest home-made jams and jellies were always on the table, freshly filled.</p>
        <p>I was happy in this job, and well satisfied with my school work. I had become more and more absorbed in the publication, particularly in a personal column which I wrote and signed in each number. It was titled "The Plain Plebeian," and had a good acceptance among the students, faculty and exchanges.</p>
        <p>Principal Naylor, beloved of many generations of students, had retired, and a bald, excitable, big man from Indiana, Reube Lawrence, had taken over the job. He was a relative of an old Wichita family, or several families, of the same name, and two or three of his nieces were or recently had been students.</p>
        <p>Lawrence must have taken the job in the belief that a year or two in the old town, with which he had long been familiar, would benefit his health. He seemed always on the verge of exploding. He taught mathematics, and took over our two-pupil Greek class. He was more interested in discipline than his aged predecessor. It was difficult for the student body to buckle down to all the new regulations.</p>
        <p>Lawrence brought with him his daughter, Florence, who became a member of our graduating class. She was a bright girl, and studious.</p>
        <p>As graduation approached, Dr. Lawrence made public the rules for competition for the commencement prizes. The first rule was that I would not be eligible to compete, since I had not taken Bible.</p>
        <p>Immediately I went to Lawrence and demanded to be heard before the entire faculty. I was accommodated, I set forth my case,
        <pb n="78" />in which I called attention to the fact that the rule had been pulled out of a hat to apply against one student only, and for the obvious purpose of giving a greater number of the class members, a chance to win prizes. I pointed out that if anyone were to bebarred from competing, it should be the Principal's daughter, first, because she was the Principal's daughter and was therefore favored in grading and secondly because she had not done the four years at this school.</p>
        <p>I asked that the special rule against me be rescinded at this meeting of the faculty, failing which I would enjoin the awarding of all prizes, through a suit at law which I would win, hands down.</p>
        <p>I left the room and awaited word. I meant every word of my ultimatum, and our attorney, Sam Amidon, would be only too glad to handle the case for me.</p>
        <p>At the end of the session I was notified that the faculty had voted to admit me to all competitions, provided 1 would compete for the Bible prize. I accepted the condition, which was a great surprise to all of them.</p>
        <p>I got a King James Bible out of the library and went to work. I was so familiar with the Douay &amp; Rheims version that I had little difficulty in coordinating the two.</p>
        <p>When Bible competition day came, I felt confident of making a fair showing. The trial took all day. The chapel was cleared of all except the contestants and three patrolling faculty members.</p>
        <p>Each contestant was handed pencils, a stack of paper, and a copy of Van Dyke's "The Other Wise Man." There was only one directive: "Read this book, identify Bible quotations, direct and indirect, giving verse and chapter where possible; also explain bearing of Bible quotations upon the story."I won first prize without difficulty, probably due to comparative
        <pb n="79" />facility in writing, since the class included an ordained minister who had spent the year at Lewis to rest and brush up.</p>
        <p>The donor of the Bible prize was a prominent real estate man, long established in the town. With his check he sent a note, saying that if I needed help in my plans for further education, I should see him.</p>
        <p>The big commencement prize was a four year college scholarship for the highest average grade throughout the course. The title was awarded to the principal's daughter, but the faculty already had ruled her out, on grounds I had put forward. The scholarship went to the next highest, a schoolteacher who had taught a year and studied a year, for a long period. She deserved the prize, though, as it happened, she could not use it. On a technicality, she might have been ruled out, because of lack of four years of continuous study, but that would not have been just. I was next in standing, and how I could have used that scholarship! It was the tragedy of almost grasping the rainbow.</p>
        <p>"But a man's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?" wrote Mr. Robert Browning, and I pondered his words.</p>
        <p>The only other important prize was for the best commencement oration. My roommate bought a canned oration from a Chicago firm, making no secret of the transaction, and got a professional coach to teach him how to deliver it. This was altogether agreeable to me, and we set cut in friendly competition which each of us felt sure of winning.</p>
        <p>I was tremendously busy with much serving. I wrote in a great-hurry a half-baked, florid, corny oration, entitled "Mehr Licht!" from the supposedly dying words of Goethe. It read so badly and sounded so tinny when I recited it to the walls of our little room, that I lost enthusiasm, and decided to use an old oration with
        <pb n="80." />which I had won three contests.</p>
        <p>We had a rehearsal a week before Commencement, at which each member of the class spouted his oration. I was ashamed of mine, and already had told the girl with the liquid eyes that I had decided not to use it. But I went through it anyway.</p>
        <p>When I sat down in the seat next to Liquid Eyes, one of the female teachers whom I knew but slightly, turned squarely around and denounced me as a plagiarist. She said I could not have written so mature a piece, and that an oration with the same title had been delivered twenty years ago by somebody she suspected me of knowing. She was a tune detective without a research department.</p>
        <p>My response was strangely restrained. I said, "never met the person you refer to. I wrote this oration, and think it's terrible. However, as a challenge to you, I'll use it, thereby losing any chance I may have to win the prize. Now go ahead and prove your accusation, and we'll have a lot of fun."Unwillingly, 1 delivered that oration, and, probably because I had been orating so steadily through four years and knew some of the tricks, I won the prize. I was not proud of it, because I knew the Chicago professional oration was much better, at least in the writing.</p>
        <p>I was a little tired of orating anyway. I determined to have no more to do with public speaking.</p>
        <p>Mother and other members of the family attended the commencement in the First Presbyterian church. Some of our Catholic friends (but few) expressed eyebrow surprise at this. On the way to the ceremonies I met Grocer Mike Courtney, as narrow-minded a pious man as ever I knew. He stopped me long enough to say, "Well, Charlie, I suppose you're going over to hear the preacher yell." I said "Good morning, Mr. Courtney," and passed on.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="81" />I had made a pilgrimage to invite Dad to attend the commencement. He gave the same answer he had given when I had had my country school commencement. "Ah, bye, I has hogs to feed." And I've often thought that is as good a reason as any for missing commencement speeches.</p>
        <p>The breakup of our class was more than usually poignant, though all young people, especially in a small school, feel bereaved at commencement. It had been officially announced in the newspapers that Lewis Academy would not reopen. This was the last of a long line of graduating classes. I had written an editorial about the break-up in the last issue of the magazine, and had wept into my manuscript as I wrote. Strangely enough that was not the last time I have wept into my copy.</p>
        <p>Mr. A. A. Hyde, the Mentholatum man, had taken over most of the burden of supporting the school, but it was too heavy a load and too discouraging a task. The denominational academies, with classical traditions, were disappearing as the buffalo had disappeared. Better public high schools and a more materialistic conception of citizenship had rolled in with the tide of Imperialism, Expansion, and Go-Getterism. Religious and ethical training were no longer considered important, and pragmatic values were being preached throughout the land.</p>
        <p>The little schools imbue pupils with lasting loyalty. Even today, I wish that small oasis had persisted.</p>
        <p>

      <div type="chapter" n="X">
        <p>Discussion of college went on in a desultory manner on the farm that summer. I had quit my city jobs and returned for what I believed and hoped to be my final fling at farm work. I had overworked during the last winter in prep school, was not strong, had occasional nosebleeds, and the heart condition seemed ominous.</p>
        <p>We were visited by a suave salesman for Fairmount college, a struggling institution on the only thing in the Wichita suburbs that might be called a hill. This was the college that, with remarkable enterprise and salesmanship, had brought thousands of preparatory students to its campus for trials of strength and oratory.</p>
        <p>Mr. E. M. Leach, driving a nice team of little chestnut horses, and wearing a becoming fedora hat, spread out his wares. The college on the hill wanted me because of my record, because I had won honors on its campus, and on and on.</p>
        <p>Very well, but as to practical matters. What could I find to do on the hill, so far from town, to pay my way?</p>
        <p>I could groom Mr. Leach's horses for a small stipend.</p>
        <p>Thank you, no. I had groomed too many horses, and I was trying almost frantically to get rid of that odor on my shoes. I wanted to go to Oberlin, but correspondence gave me little hope that I might fall into a job on the day of my arrival, and I would need money at once. Already I had determined to go through with a straight classical course, leaning heavily on languages and philosophy. Then, if a possibility offered, I might try for a medical education. I scanned catalogs for schools laying least stress upon mathematics, which I loathed, and showing
        <pb n="83" />most interest in the classics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leach used his reserve bomb.</p>
        <p>"Mrs. Driscoll," he said, with a bedside manner that later got him elected to public office, "come up and live with us! Sell the farm, for the sake of this boy's future, and buy a house on Fairmount, near the college, I have a nice list of properties that may be had at reasonable coats. The fact is, you have done enough farming. In a few years you will be wanting to sell anyhow. Why not sell now and come up and live with us on beautifulFairmount?"We lost interest completely. I rode my bicycle over to Friends University, far out on the West Side, and talked with summer students, professors, the janitor, and neighbors. Always my query was, "Do you know of any job I might get that would make it possible for me to study at Friends?"Day after day I went questing. I became such a familiar figure about the campus and neighborhood that an alumnus, living a short distance from the campus, heard about the pest who didn't know what you meant when you said no. He asked me to call at his home in the evening.</p>
        <p>"You were editor of the Lewis Academy News, weren't you?""Yes.""You will go to Friends. My neighbor, Mr. Sidney Long, is circulation manager of The Eagle. I'll talk to him at Sunday school, where he teaches the biggest class in term. Call on him at his office Monday. He'll have a job for you."Mr. Long, worried, overworked, harried, gray-haired man with long teeth that were uncared-for, rubbed his wrinkled brow and said, with an impediment caused by the bad teeth, "You have important recommendations. But you did some soliciting for us,
        <pb n="84." />didn't you?""Yes sir, but the less said about that the better.""I thought the same. You are not a good solicitor. I'll give you a job at four dollars a week, calling carriers. On duty six mornings a week, including Sunday, at one o'clock. The young man whose place you take will explain the duties. Friends boys never fail in our employ. I will expect as much of you as we have had from hundreds of them. If you fail, you disgrace your school as well as The Eagle and yourself."I listened respectfully, and a date was arranged, simultaneous with the opening of classes, for me to go to work.</p>
        <p>Then I took up the matter of credits with the University registrar. Some work I had done for college credit was discarded as not of college calibre. But I had enough certified college credits, acceptable to the state university, to admit me as a conditioned sophomore. By hard work I could clean up the credits needed during the first year. I was in heaven.</p>
        <p>Four dollars a week was a lot of money. Could I stretch it enough to make it go around? I scouted for a boarding house, engaged a room with board, conditional upon another student's taking half the room. The price was low enough, surprisingly low. The mistress of the email gray cottage was a Quaker lady known to all the Quaker West Side as Aunt Lida Lyons, the first name pronounced Lidy, to rhyme with tidy, which she was.</p>
        <p>I knew I could pick up a little change here and there after I became naturalized. In the university neighborhood, so I was not worried about the plunge, though the fluid seemed likely to reach slightly over my head.</p>
        <p>I worked hard during the rest of the summer. Mother permitted 
        <pb n="85" />me to keep a part of my take on each load of produce I sold, to pay for books and essential clothes.</p>
        <p>Van did not come home for the summer. He said he had to stay on at the Detention Home, the county's place for delinquent boys. Van had a persuasive way with children and youth. He was doing good work at the Home, was liked by the boys and management, and was now getting slightly higher pay than his initial salary.</p>
        <p>Van wrote that he was greatly indebted to a priest named Father Flanagan for interest and help he extended in the effort to make good citizens out of these boys who had offended against the law in so many ways. Father Flanagan was only a young curate in a small church, but Van sought him out, took droves of boys to him for advice and counsel, and always took boys to him for confession before they (the Catholic boys, of course) were put on the train for the State Reformatory in Kearney.</p>
        <p>Mother read Van's letters, and was happy that he was progressing in school, and already had become a leader in the political and literary life of such a large institution. She approved my plans for attendance at Friends, since it was impossible to find a Catholic college where I could make my way. As a matter of fact, experience with the Presbyterian school had broken down all fears that attending sectarian schools might befoul my religious life. One year of some kind of religious instruction was required for graduation at Friends. This time Mother did not ask that the requirement be waived. I signed up for a year, five tines a week, of History of Israel, under patriarchial [sic] Dr. William Pearson, graduate of Leipsic, Germany.</p>
        <p>From early childhood I had been impressed by the majestic mass and pleasing lines of the big brick-and-stone building known
        <pb n="86" />as Garfield university. We could see it looming impressively in the west, facing the country road called University avenue, when we drive to church over the Iron Bridge during periods of flood that made the Hydraulic avenue bridge unsafe. At such times we drove several miles out of the way, skirting the bend of the river until we arrived on the West Side, sometimes called West Wichita, and crossed into the main part of town onDouglas avenue over that structure of which the sprawling town was so proud, the Iron Bridge, both words always capitalized.</p>
        <p>President James A. Garfield was a member of the Christian church, commonly called Campbellite. When he was assassinated, he became a national hero and martyr. Prominent and wealthy members of the church combined with Wichita boom real estate promoters, conceived the plan to build on the Kansas plains a great university dedicated to his memory.</p>
        <p>The realty men gathered up a quarter section of land, far out in the country, and gave it to the church people as an inducement. Funds and mortgages were raised, and this gigantic building put up. The interior was only partly finished. Garfield university opened for a winter or two, then locked the doors, boarded up the windows, and let the bondholders take over.</p>
        <p>During my boyhood the great landmark was inhabited only by bats, rats, mice and a few opossums. One day a Quaker from St. Louis, James M. Davis, who had made millions selling stereoptican views, stopped in the town, went for a ride, was struck by the loneliness of the big plant, crawled through a window, and bought the place for a song before he left town. He gave it to the Society of Friends.</p>
        <p>At the time of my admission, the school was reaching for
        <pb n="87" />an ultimate enrollment of five hundred. When I left it was still reaching, but was close to the goal.</p>
        <p>The college (never a real university, but always aspiring) lived a constant struggling existence, finishing a few more rooms in the unfinished portions each summer, to provide space for increasing attendance.</p>
        <p>Tuition was sixty dollars per semester. I had not been in school two weeks until I was approached by a tall, delicate-looking young man, Clifton Row, who was editor of University Life and a practical printer who got out the publication weekly on a foot-power flat-bed press in the basement. He said that the print shop, privately owned by an enterprising Prof. Benjamin Truesdell, was taking in job printing from smallWest Side firms, and that he would have to give up the editor-ship in order to have more time for printing.</p>
        <p>Would I take the job? Row's name would continue as editor-in-chief at the masthead, with mine as associate editor, until mid-year, just because it wouldn't look well to other colleges to see a student take the editorship as soon as he hit the campus.</p>
        <p>I agreed enthusiastically, and entered upon a pleasant and rewarding (not financially) editorship that lasted for two full years. The business end, as customary in much more important newspapers, took the money brought in by advertising, and divided it according to a plan long ago agreed upon,Editing the paper was fun, even though I had to do practically all the writing, proofreading and editing, as had bean the case at the Academy. It was good experience. I have never subscribed to the snap judgment of some managing editors of the old school who say, or used to say, "If a guy asks for a cub job and says he was editor of the college paper, send him away."
        <pb n="88" />The average college editor is well started in preliminary cub-hood when he finishes a journalistic experience that leads up through staff to editorship. In my case, peculiar conditions made it imperative that I start as editor in both schools, without staff experience, but the strain was not too great.</p>
        <p>The boarding house, at 1616 University avenue, was about three quarters of a mile from the college entrance and three miles from the Eagle building. I had a bicycle which was compounded of a very old and heavy tubular iron frame, picked up in a junk yard, with new wheels and other equipment, including a New Departure coaster brake. It vas a heavy-duty bicycle, and served me well.</p>
        <p>There were no street cars running at the hour of my going to work. The streets were now paved, however, all the way into town. Wichita had grown since the postboom era of my childhood, when first I conceived the yearning to enter that wonderful big building at the end of the country road that University avenue then was.</p>
        <p>I had to rise not later than the end of the first half hour of the day in order to throw on my work clothes and race to the publishing building at Market and William streets.</p>
        <p>My first duty was to sit at Mr. Long's desk and go over the starts and stops. A start was a slip of paper on which was noted name and address of somebody who had ordered delivery of the paper started this morning. A stop was the exact opposite.</p>
        <p>In the rear was the mail room, divided from the press room by a counter. In space given over partly to city carriers were forty-five sharp hooks, nailed to wooden walls and pillars. Each of these had a number, one to forty-five, with the name of the carrier who carried that route pasted beneath.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="89" />I had a carrier route map of the city. With this in hand, until I had committed it to memory, I distributed stops and starts, putting each on its proper hook, so that there might not be delay in obeying the customers' orders.</p>
        <p>The only other student present while I was thus engaged was tall, powerful, Farmer Bill Newman, a Quaker from some distant Kansas farm, known at the college as a hard worker and a plugger. He had had the calling job, but was now promoted to counter, as I moved into the bottom rung.</p>
        <p>The counter stood beside, the folding apparatus at the end of the long Hoe press. There was only one press at this time, and it was old and decrepit. It broke down many tines during a press run. That was why we had to start so early to get some thirty thousand morning papers to their subscribers.</p>
        <p>The press automatically folds "on the half" and counts papers into fifties as they run along to delivery. The counter had before him an up-to-thisï¿½morning list of carriers with number of papers to be delivered to each. If a carrier was entitled to two hundred thirty-five papers this morning (the count changed each morning for almost every carrier, since stops and starts were always coming in), Bill Newman picked five fifty-paper bunches off the delivery line, slammed the armful on the wide table dividing press from carriers, picked fifteen papers off the pile and stacked them in an "over" pile, marked the carrier's number with a blunt crayon on the top paper, and stepped back to pick up the next carrier's quota. Each carrier was given three extra papers for emergencies.</p>
        <p>The piles were not stacked in numerical order. The carrier who had the longest or most difficult route, farthest from the center of town, was counted and delivered first. This, during my service
        <pb n="90" />there, was a lad named Corzine, who had miles of route to deliver from a one-horse cart, in the College Hill area.</p>
        <p>There was a story connected with the Corzine route. When College Hill and the southeastern part of town constituted open country, with many uninhabited blocks and only a few houses to the square mile, the eldest son of the big and growing family of a small grocer wanted to go to college. Sidney Long told him that if he would carry Route Nine, the devil's own route, he would promise never to cut it while he carried it. Sidney said College Hill was the coming residential section, and that in four years, when the ambitious student completed his course, it ought to be paying handsomely. Corzine took the route, upon extracting from Long a promise that the bargain went for him and for his brothers, as long as any of them should elect to hold the route.</p>
        <p>Sidney kept his promise, as was his wont. The little fellow with the running nose who now carried the route to pay his school expenses was the fourth Corzine to ride that promise through school, with the help of plenty of hard work. It was still the longest route in town, but also the most profitable.</p>
        <p>I have heard fabulous stories in the intervening years about the Corzine route. I'm told that the last of the brothers held on to it after leaving school, finding no business as profitable. Long ago the area became one of the best in town, thickly populated by people who can afford to take a paper. Streets were paved years ago, and the Corzines took to automobiles for delivery of their mountains of papers. If they still hold the route they probably make as much money as the publisher.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XI">
        <p>Since the rural telephone and daily mail delivery had come to the farm, life was not so lonesome as it had been. I subscribed for the Daily and Sunday Eagle for Mother and John, so that they might see how important an institution I was helping to keep on the map. Now the news of the world and of the town was in the old home that had been so isolated. John spent most of the time, after Carrier Bell, with his sturdy little team hitched to his box-like mail wagon had deposited the mail in the iron box at the corner, in reading the paper. Occasionally he would read aloud an item to Mother. Finished, he would go out to do the "shores." The only Irish pronunciation that John got from Big Flurry and retained throughout life was "shores" for chores. He mispronounced many words in original, grotesque ways, and sternly resented correction, even by innuendo. But this was his only Irishism.</p>
        <p>The farmers of the Valley formed a telephone company with the help and direction of the Independent company, which competed with the Bell system in Wichita. It was not one of the barbed wire circuits, such as were springing up in less favored areas. We had small poles carrying two wires, and there were many parties on each circuit.</p>
        <p>"Hanging on," meaning listening in on party line conversations, was an almost universal practice. It furnished more and better entertainment to the lonely housewife than the radio does today. This is demonstrable fact. I know of rural neighborhoods in several parts of the country where housewives turn off "David Harum" and the other soap operas to hang on and learn what kind of a dress Mrs. Leonard is going to wear at the pie social. There is not any secrecy or dishonor attaching to this practice now, although when Mother began hanging on to ease her loneliness she felt that it was a vice, and no doubt confessed it.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="92" />The rural housewife today at least in many communities, meets her neighbor at the A &amp; P in the village and says, "So your sister's coining to visit you from Out West! Isn't that grand! I heard you talking to the station agent about the train.</p>
        <p>Mother told us news of the Valley whenever we met. Shamefacedly, she admitted that she hung on. "I get so lonesome, you know," she said. She told how two foolish lovers, living a mile and a quarter apart, would call each other up, say hallo, and then just listen to each others breathing, without uttering a word. Mother thought this the height of nonsense, since, obviously, many hanger son were breathing into the line, and the lovers could hardly distinguish one from another,I think they could. The breathing of the one you love is different. Even if she has a head cold. Anyway, those two foolish lovers were married, had children, and, last time I heard of them, were heads of one of the substantial scientific farm families in the Valley.</p>
        <p>__________Carriers had the general obligation to get the paper on the porch of every subscriber before breakfast. They must report, signing a register with time of arrival, when they entered the plant. First, always, was Number Nine, Corzine. After registering, he went to the pile of mall bags and, with his stocking cap on, if the weather were cold, he would fall asleep at once.</p>
        <p>I had to check arrivals and non-arrivals closely. There were limits as to how late a carrier for a given route could arrive. By two o'clock the first fifteen were registered and sleeping on or under mail bags.</p>
        <p>The press usually started at three, on the city edition. But it was unpredictable. Sometimes it would be down for hours,
        <pb n="93" />generally the break would last five to twenty minutes. Paper tore as it came from the rolls,| and stoppage was necessary in order to unfoul the cylinders and patch the roll.</p>
        <p>By three-thirty, a long line of stacks of papers should be on the table I would look at the list of check-ins, and start calling the first in line as soon as his pile was ready.</p>
        <p>"Corzine! Corzine! Number Nine! Papers ready; look alive, Corzine!"If I found him among the sleeping forms and nail bags, I shook him awake. Sleepily, he staggered toward his pile, shouldered it, and packed it out to his waiting cart.</p>
        <p>Most of the boys used bicycles, and carried their papers in a two-pocket canvas bag, slung over the shoulders. On a good route, a boy needed to be strong. But many were not.</p>
        <p>About four o'clock, I began calling Leisure. He was George Leisure, a thin, pale, long-nosed, high-browed Quaker from Slater, Mo., who was never late, but was difficult to waken, once he was in among the mail bags. George never spoke to me as he got to his feet and strode sleepily over to the counter for his papers. But I thought the blue eyes and stern visage held a superior sort of rebuke for me when he looted at me as a prince might gaze upon the herdsman who was about to raise his axe. George needed sleep. He was working too hard, carrying too many subjects, and indulging in no relaxation. I silently picked him as the bright boy who might die of tuberculosis, induced by overwork.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leisure, I should say, is either Number One lawyer in New York, or so close to that post that you'd have to use a photoelectric cell to get the verdict. He's of the firm of Donovan &amp; Leisure, and has homes on Park avenue and in Mt. Kisco. Sometimes we lunch together, and talk about those mail bags, which were not
        <pb n="94." />always devoid of bedbugs.</p>
        <p>My first roommate at Aunt Lida's was a dark, extremely thin young man named Laird Archer. He was something new in my gallery of roommates. A well-reared, well-mannered young fellow, son of a widow, his people had been well-to-do in Argonia, Kansas, but after the death of his father the family fortunes had declined rapidly, and it was now essential that Laird find work, without a collegiate interlude. My first impression was that it might be a terrible bore, rooming with a person who had not the study drive that meant so much to students.</p>
        <p>Archer was a sensitive young man, somewhat younger than I. When I learned that ink and paper and rolling presses were in his blood, I began to take a serious interest. Yes, his mother's brother was publisher of a string of newspapers in Michigan. As Laird hoped also to bacons a worker in some field connected with the printed word, he had written his uncle, who had provided him with an introduction to Henry J. Allen, editor and publisher of the Wichita Beacon, the Eagle's competitor. Allen had talked with the boy, and told him he would take a personal interest in his progress because of his long-standing friendship with the uncle. Allen, who proved to be one of the most brilliant publisher-editors in the history of Kansas, was at this time struggling to establish the third-rate newspaper he had bought for a small price. Kansas was for prohibition. The Eagle was against it. Allen, no teetotaller [sic] himself, sensed the direction of the wind, and started his editorship with a vigorous campaign for enforcement of anti-liquor laws.</p>
        <p>Allen was 41, full of experience and energy, a keen watcher of dimes and one-cent pieces. He accepted Archer, not as a reporter, which Laird had hoped for, but as his personal secretary.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="95" />Laird was not a stenographer. Allen intended him for the kind of secretary that doesn't take a letter. However, the publisher regretfully informed the lad that he could not think of paying him a salary, at least for the present.</p>
        <p>Knowing the stature of the man he was going to work for, from assurances of his uncle, Archer, after serious consultation with his mother, took the job.</p>
        <p>Laird was as poorly and respectably dressed as it would be possible to be. He took meticulous care of his clothes, conserved shirts and handkerchiefs, sent his washing home once a week, as did I, but was always clean.</p>
        <p>He had bad eyes, one slightly crossed and neither one too good. He was of delicate build, and did not appear to be well nourished. I found him such excellent company that I often was tempted to neglect my studies while we talked of our work and our ambitions in cur small room. We slept in the same bed.</p>
        <p>Laird grew extremely fond of Allen, whom he admired almost to the point of worship. Since I was getting four dollars a week from the mighty machine which this newcomer from Abeline was challenging with his loud-speaking little paper, I loyally hated Allen and all his works. But Laird and I never discussed the respective merits of the papers and their proprietors. My only wicked thrust was an occasional suggestion that if Mr. Allen were such a magnanimous gentleman, why did he work a poor secretary almost to death without paying him a cent, and why was anybody so foolish as to work so hard on such terms?</p>
        <p>"I know that Mr. Allen will make it up to me," said the sad-faced young man. "He is a just man and a great man, and it is a privilege to associate with him, even if I were only his valet. But he shares his experience and his great knowledge with me as
        <pb n="96" />if I were an equal. He advises me, and his advice is practical and well-seasoned. He will be governor of this state some day, and he has the stuff to be President of the United States. I can starve for a while." Starve was not hyperbole. Laird ate one meal a day, dinner at Aunt Lida's. He went hungry the rest of the day, or ate peanuts or some such stuff to kill his appetite. He did not flourish on this diet.</p>
        <p>I was not any too healthy myself, and if we had known anything about hemoglobin I might have fainted. But I was entitled to three coals a day at Aunt Lida's, if 1 had time to eat them. My routine at the office, together with class schedules, generally made it impossible for me to eat breakfast, though I was always hungry for it after working hard since close to midnight.</p>
        <p>There was a difference of opinion between the roommates as to whose clothes were in worse condition. Laird could sew; I could not. When he went through the seat of his trousers, he made shift to make the garment last another two or three months by skilled needlework, I sent mine home, and not infrequently went to class with honest, well-sewn patches, undisguised.</p>
        <p>There was a little heat in the house in cold weather, which made it comfortable as compared with the house in which I had spent most of my preparatory winters.</p>
        <p>After several months of starvation and deprivation, Laird developed an ulcerated condition under a tooth, as often happens in such cases. He suffered great pain. I, who also was subject to frequently recurring toothaches, gave him access to my medicines, all palliatives, such as campho-phenique. Laird slept little, but was careful not to disturb my brief slumbers. For a week he went to work with a swollen jaw, in constant pain. One day he fainted in Allen's office.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="97" />Allen called a doctor, who made a quick report on the young man's condition. The publisher sent Archer to his own dentist, directing that the bill be charged to the Allen account. When the boy was able to be back at work, he was put on a salary, small, to be sure, but something better than starvation.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder at all to me that Laird Archer has made starvation his life study, and its relief his life work. The current "Who's Who in America" lists him as foreign director of the Near East Foundation, with office in the American Embassy, Athens, Greece.</p>
        <p>Henry J. Allen justified Archer's faith in him. He recognized the ability that was screened by Laird's natural modesty and a tendency to self-effacement. There did not appear to be a great future for Laird's special talents in the Beacon. But Henry had other ideas. He was a close personal friend of Anne Morgan, sister of John Pierpont Morgan and promoter of many benevolent enterprises.</p>
        <p>After the First War to End Wars, Miss Morgan sent Henry J. Allen on a tour of the Near East, for an honest checkup on starvation conditions, particularly among the displaced Greeks. Allen asked Archer to accompany him, still in the capacity of personal secretary, minus stenography.</p>
        <p>So well did Archer acquit himself that Miss Morgan, on suggestion of Allen, took him over. As the wars and famines roll on and on, Archer remains chief motivating figure in keeping American food and money flowing to bereft orphans of the storm. His factual diary, "Balkan Journal," giving first-hand accounts of incidents and conditions accompanying the German conquest of Greece, at which he was present, was one of the informative documents of the Second War to End Wars.</p>
        <p>When Archer left Aunt Lida's to take up residence closer to
        <pb n="98" />his boss, I had to take any acceptable roommate who offered the landlady the specified price. One of these was a young Quaker farm boy known on the campus as Serious Hill, though I believe his baptism name was Charles. He was never called anything but Serious. Like most of the rest of us, he was poor, from a family that could appreciate all the economy he could exercise.</p>
        <p>Serious end I were never close companions. His total lack of a vestige of a sense of humor appalled me. I was becoming more and more interested in writing, possibly as a career. Repeatedly I asked myself, "But if there are many Serious Hills among the subscribers, how are you going to make a living?" I pondered, and often looked at the leathery, sagging face of my roommate, as he sat by the lamp, studying, wondering how I could make him laugh. During college years Serious went in for oratory. It was not difficult to beat him in the contests, but each defeat increased his personal animosity. Had he not been a good Quaker, I am sure he would have given me a physical beating, which I probably deserved, and which he certainly could have given.</p>
        <p>I reflected often that there are many advantages in attending a Quaker college, and one of the important ones is the slightness of the risk of being beaten up.</p>
        <p>It was essential that I retire early and sleep fast, in order to rise refreshed at twelve-thirty for my tour of duty. When Serious became my unwelcome roommate, he brought his group of half a dozen boys to spend evenings in fun and social exercises, such as wrestling, knocking over furniture, loud talk and laughter. This program subtracted from my sleep and efficiency.</p>
        <p>I protested, but the rowdy racket went on, night after night. In my super sensitive condition and hunger for sleep, it seemed plain to me that this program was malicious, for the sole purpose
        <pb n="99" />of depriving me of sleep. Probably it was not that way at all. The young men simply were uncouth, and perhaps lacked something of what it takes to make a gentlemen [sic], namely, consideration for others. Anyway, I wrote an editorial, entitled, "Rowdyism."It was a legitimate appeal to students to avoid giving their college a bad reputation by acting like hoodlums, and an exhortation to gentlemanly behavior.</p>
        <p>I was visited by a delegation of five, including my Serious roommate. The spokesman was a farm boy, Cliff Watson, who was making southing of a reputation for himself as a good student.</p>
        <p>The spokesman said, "We think that that editorial on rowdyism was aimed directly at us."I replied, "Right."Disconcerted by the declaration, when he had expected pious disclaimer, the spokesman flamed and paled, swallowed and blinked his eyes, searching for the next sentence.</p>
        <p>"We're going to hold you responsible for it," he said.</p>
        <p>"By all means," I replied.</p>
        <p>Still further taken aback by this turn of events, the spokesman floundered. Finally he blurted out, "We want you to understand that we are going to hold you accountableï¿½and responsible.""Certainly," I said, "I wouldn't want anybody to give anybody else the credit for that editorial, and I surely wouldn't want the readers to think I was referring to some other bunch of rowdies."The delegation walked out. That was the first of uncounted delegations that came to ma through the journalistic years, demanding vague accounting, satisfaction, or delivering threats. I handled them all as I handled the college boys. Admit authorship and responsibility, take back nothing, and stand by for action.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XII">
        <p>In his early days as trustee-proprietor of the farm, John had joined the Knights of Columbus, at one of the society's earliest initiations in Wichita. He was listed as a charter member, and because he had really phenomenal skill in inscribing names, as they were, and often still are, inscribed on diplomas, charters, proclamations and other formal documents, John was given the original charter, on vellum, which had blank space sufficient for inscription of names of all charter members. He was given a typewritten list of those names, and the inscribing assignment.</p>
        <p>The job would pay a nominal sum, twenty-five or fifty dollars. John had done some college diploma work, and had been offered enough such work for higher educational institutions and lodges that he could have made a good living from his skill, but he refused most offers. He accepted the K of C charter only because of his enthusiasm for the new secret society. The social contracts at the weekly meetings and the impressive religious rite of the corporate communions, once a month, were wine to John's social consciousness.</p>
        <p>The inscriptive lettering involved is called, in the trade, engrossing. There is a special pen. Skill in operating this pen is rare, and always in demand. The work is not hard on eyes, because the strokes are heavy, and usually broad. A fine quality of black India ink is used,John had quarts of the ink, and no other member of the family dared to think of the crime of opening one of those bottles. He spent many evenings, Sunday afternoons and rainy days, practicing engrossing on the cleared dining room table. He used only heavy coated foolscap for this practice. He had model alphabets
        <pb n="101" />in old English, German and Gothic, with many variations. John's artisanship asserted itself in original variations of his own. When John finished a line in his mere or lass original engrossing, it looted like steel engraving come to life. His hand and eye were perfect for this work. He studied steel engravings, night after night.</p>
        <p>I suggested to Mother that she encourage John to take on commissions for engrossing diplomas and important documents. Before we younger boys started to school, I proposed that John might spend most of his time that way, exercising only the prerogatives of a gentleman supervisor of farm work. Hired men and Van and I could do the actual sweat faming, and John could contribute his earnings to the common fund. Certainly, he was a better engrosser and penman than farmer.</p>
        <p>When Mother talked to John about it, he raised his eyebrows, corked the ink jug, end looked out of the window. The nearest to an answer to this proposition he ever vouchsafed was, "Those days have gone. I was once a man among men, but now behold me, an ass among fools!"With melancholy slow-motion he put away his ink, pens and charter. Though he seemed to find solace in making ovals and practicing the esoteric art of inscribing names, as upon an eternal roll of honor, he refused to prostitute his art for hire, much as the family treasury needed funds.</p>
        <p>Now came a tragic accident, remindful of those flashes of punishing lightning that Jove often, in a moment of jealousy or caprice, hurled at his talented favorites upon the earth.</p>
        <p>Husking corn, John contracted an infection in his right thumb, exactly as his father, Big Flurry, had done a good many years earlier. It was not an unusual thing for a farmer to cut his
        <pb n="102" />thumb on a sharp edge of a dried husk, while tearing the husk from the ear with a husking pin. All corn farmers had scarred thumbs on the husking hand.</p>
        <p>Such a cut might become infected as might any other cut, but in the cornfields lurked the dangerous smut, a black, dusty, parasitic fungus which formed at the end of the ear, was mostly exposed to the air, and was mixed with the silk and ends of the husks. This is the stuff that blinded farm horses with what was commonly called blind staggers, and blinded many farm people, especially in Tennessee and Kentucky, with the terrible disease known as glaucoma. It is related to the fungi from which have been compounded penicillin and other "miracle drugs," by skilled men who know how to turn bad into good, evil into a blessing.</p>
        <p>When smut, common after wet seasons, was smeared into an open husk cut, there was apt to be trouble.</p>
        <p>Big Flurry, at this time, was carrying on his own farming with the handicap of "the damned old tumb" that had caused him a winter's misery after such an infection, and had stiffened permantly [sic] after an operation to relieve the infected joint. John's thumb infection was in the same spot and followed the same course. It was on his right, or husking, hand.</p>
        <p>Customary home remedies, flaxseed poultices and hot packs led nowhere, except to spreading infection, John visited Doctor Thomas, a tall, hard-drinking friend of Ed Blood's, who wore a high silk hat and handlebar mustache, morning, noon, and evening. He was a good Elk, and eventually broke his neck falling down the front stairway of the comfortable Elks building, around the corner from his office. In this accident one might find another flash of Jove's lightning, possibly to save some present favorite from destructive effects of contact with the handsome rake's sharp but unskilled scalpel.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="103" />It was a minor operation, but Thomas gave a general anaesthetic, probably because he didn't know about locals. It was performed in the doctor's office. Mother sat without, praying and weeping. I arrived from school, having cut a class, and found the waiting room a mourner's bench; Mother, Marie, and a few friends and children of the families, gathered to pray for the speedy recovery of Poor John.</p>
        <p>The patient made the routine recovery. His general health was in no way affected, but the writing and engrossing hand was crippled by a stiffened thumb, exactly as Big Flurry's best working hand had been crippled.</p>
        <p>The hand that John had refused to use to engross the charter, to paint the pictures, to finish the fine furniture he had once begun, to do the proffered diplomas; in general to execute the talent with which he was endowed, was now crippled. Not seriously, from the viewpoint of farmers, but destructively from the viewpoint of art.</p>
        <p>Call me superstitious, religious, or what you will; from observation, and not from teaching, I have deduced this universal law:He who has a gift, and perversely refuses to use it, shall have it taken from him.</p>
        <p>The intimations of this universal law extend to physical strength and skill, to talents, large and small, and to education, acquired with or without great labors.</p>
        <p>Even in the case of John, who sulked in his artistic tent because he had not been privileged to go to Paris for art education, but instead had been thrown into the hard life of a frontier farm, you do not have to create a deus ex machina to explain the tragedy, but you will if you are artistically, poetically or religiously minded.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="104" />Thousands in John's position and in much worse ones have fought their way out, have done their works of art in the desert, foundry, shantytown or prison. If one of these had been in John's place he might have done the income-producing engrossing jobs, and thus been able to hire a man to husk all the corn, and save his skilled thumb for posterity's enlightenment. Or other conditions might have been created, having the same result.</p>
        <p>Gift, talent, or educated skill is not infrequently used by its possessor as a means of tormenting the anxious friend, wife, mother or public, by petulant refusal to work, by perverse conduct, by sheer glorification of laziness.</p>
        <p>Robert Browning expresses a phase of my meaning through Andreadel Sarto:In this world, who can do a thing will not;And who would do it, cannot, I perceive.</p>
        <p>I knew a young woman whose mother spent her life, income and energy to train and educate her. The mother's comfort, in old age, was to hear the daughter play the piano, which she did passing well.</p>
        <p>In a huff about a new dress, which should have passed in half an hour, the daughter refused to play the piano to soothe the gentle mother's ear. Nor did she ever touch the instrument again. Mother was punished through her failing years, because, after a lifetime of sacrifice and labor, she could not agree about a dress for one evening's celebration. The daughter, naturally, lost her ability to play, as well as all the ability she ever had to entertain and to make friends. Her life turned bitter and sere.</p>
        <p>John Noble was one of the great and eccentric characters originating in our town. He was born in Wichita when the place was an Indian trading post, and often boasted that he shot buffalo 
        <pb n="105" />on the ground later occupied by the City Hall.</p>
        <p>I may have occasion to tell his story, which I consider interesting, later. For now, this is enough: When he was established as a painter with international reputation, he used to work for months on a picture, and, when praised, cut it to shreds with a razor. Rather than work, he would roam the streets, get drunk, and fight policemen. He was getting even with somebody, but eventually died in the struggle to get even with everybody.</p>
        <p>Our John went back to his penholder, ink and writing gear that winter, after the soreness had gone out of his thumb.</p>
        <p>One Sunday afternoon when I was home, I observed his practicing. He had mastered a new grip of the penholder, and was going along with his muscular movement quite creditably. Fortunately, he had never flexed and unflexed his thumb in writing, anyway, since the impulse for the pen all came from the arm and shoulder.</p>
        <p>I looked at a sheet of paper upon which John had Just written many times something about a fox. I said, "Why, your penmanship is just as good as ever! Isn't it remarkable!"John leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes for a few seconds, opened them, and said, "Have the horses been watered?"I do not know whether he ever complained to Mother about the damage the operation had done to his hand. Probably he did. Mother was extremely sympathetic with him in his affliction, and told me that she had reason to believe that this was the major tragedy of John's life. I spoke of Professor Pence, who wrote such beautiful lettering without hands. Said Mother, "Never mention that before John. It would hurt him to be compared with Pence, who wrote only shaded Spencerian." The charter never was lettered.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="106" />One of my sleepy carriers was Howard Kershner, a Quaker boy from Tescott, Kansas, if there is any such place. He was a few years younger than I, and two years behind me in college. He was known as Diogenes in school, because it was thought that he must be thinking deeply during his long periods of abstraction and silence. There was a legend that he kept a flashlight in his coat pocket, and frequently used it in his persistent search for an honest man. I think he kept the searchlight, flashlight or box of matches for finding numbers of houses on his route, on which he embarked at an extremely early hour.</p>
        <p>Kershner and his brother, Hayden, tried out for oratory and debate in school, but both were slow on their feet. Howard took his colleagues' fun-making with a serious face, but without rancor. He studied hard and did fairly well in his classes, but needed prodding to get him out on his route,Howard Kershner ate at Aunt Lida's, but also in the men's dormitory, where food was said to be scarce and durable. Like Archer, he has been obsessed with the needs of hungry people all his life. His career has been made up chiefly of feeding starving children of Europe, mostly under Friends auspices. He has written much on the subject of starvation.</p>
        <p>__________Not that the food at Aunt Lida's was notably worse than that of the average boarding house for college people at that time. Nearly all of us were country people, accustomed to bountiful tables of home-cooked food.</p>
        <p>I think I might have got through the course at Aunt Lida's if it had not been for her green tomato pie. Nearly everybody on the West side had kitchen gardens in large back yards. As soon as frost threatened, the green tomatoes were worthless. Gladly
        <pb n="107" />the owners donated them to anyone who would pick them and haul them away.</p>
        <p>When she smelled frost in the air, Lida, a masterful woman of commanding presence, said to her little husband, who may have been the original model for Casper Milquetoast, "Clark, go out and get green tomatoes." "All right," said Clark.</p>
        <p>He hitched the horse to the little wagon, drove about the neighborhood, worked in the sun all day, and returned with the wagon-bed nicely loaded with green tomatoes.</p>
        <p>That would be about the second week of school, in the fall. Green tomato pie would be the dessert for dinner until about Christmas, when the fiendish fruits could no longer be kept even partially edible.</p>
        <p>The exact recipe for the fatal dessert I do not know. It consisted of a basic pie-crust, along the bottom of which slices of green tomatoes were spread in one or two layers. No top crust. Some sugar or vinegar, I am not sure which, was added, and the thing baked a few minutes.</p>
        <p>The slices of green tomatoes were still half raw when you ate them. Some of the customers died, sore were taken with gastroenteritis, and one or two went insane. The others ate out at convenient intervals, or patronized osteopaths. One beautiful classmate of mine was a Christian Scientist. She was an athlete, full of fun and vigor. She laughed at the slightest provocation, had beautiful teeth and eyes, and never complained of the food. She ate two meals a day at home, however, for she lived in the city.</p>
        <p>One of the boarders was a tall, dark, gaunt young man of the Freshman class. He came of a poor family, south of town, and had made something of a record for advancement in studies in the country
        <pb n="108" />high school. He was the only one of seven or eight children that the parents thought they might be able to send through college, provided there were no extraordinary expenses.</p>
        <p>From the first, it was evident that Forrest felt out of place. He drew away from other boarders, from his classmates. He wore poor clothes, but no worse than those worn by most of us. He was awkward, unpolished, wore his hair long and badly combed, and did not seem to get the hang of city manners. However, the school swarmed with country boys who were still combing sand burs out of their hair, and we saw no good reason for this young man's reticence. After a few approaches in the usual college style, most of the students let him alone.</p>
        <p>Forrest had only one confidante, Aunt Lida. He told her one day that he was so worried that he couldn't attend classes, and asked if he might help in the kitchen, to take his mind off his worries. The privilege was granted.</p>
        <p>After an hour of steady work, Forrest divulged that his worry was over the fact that he had not paid his tuition in advance, because he had not enough money. Mrs. Lyons told him that that was no cause for worry. Many of the students did not pay in advance, and were accepted on their word that they would pay when they could.</p>
        <p>The young can stated darkly that his case was different, and that President Stanley did not understand it. He would give no hint as to why his case was different.</p>
        <p>Aunt Lida wrote to the young man's parents, telling them that she believed the student was over-sensitive about debt, and was not doing well in school because of his worrying.</p>
        <p>Tuition money arrived at once, and Aunt Lida went to the university treasurer's office with Forrest to pay in the money and
        <pb n="109." />see the receipt delivered.</p>
        <p>Now, she told the worried young man, everything would be all right, and he could go back to classes. He did, but continued to worry, and developed a habit of hiding behind doors or running to his room when a stranger entered.</p>
        <p>He looked out the windows furtively, and hastily retired upon seeing somebody cross the street, Aunt Lida questioned him.</p>
        <p>"That detective the President has sent to watch me is outside the window," he said.</p>
        <p>Now, listen, your tuition is paid. Why should President Stanley have a detective after you?""On account of the five dollars," said the young man, helplessly,"What five dollars?""Well, you know, we were five dollars short on the tuition. Here comes the detective now; excuse me."So Aunt Lida asked jovial, happy-go-lucky, benevolent old President Stanley to come and talk to Forrest, since the boy would not go to the President's office,The President drove over the same evening. Forrest entered the room trembling.</p>
        <p>"I'll give up, Mr. President!" he said, "I'm guilty!" Vainly, the great-soiled educator tried, to calm the confused boy. He reasoned with him in a calm voice, prayed with him, and asked him to go home to his parents and rest. "You have been studying too hard, and that never did anybody any good," he said.</p>
        <p>When the officers cane, they found Forrest pulling up dead weeds in a neighbor's back yard. The poor fellow explained that if they'd let him alone for a day he'd earn the five dollars and
        <pb n="110" />pay the President.</p>
        <p>Aunt Lida was relating the last sad scenes to the collegiate crowd at luncheon, next day. Husband Clark, in white apron, was waiting table.</p>
        <p>"The last thing he said to me as they drove away," said the landlady, wiping away a tear, "was that I should send him at the sanitarium one of my green tomato pies."Clark paused, rested his tray, and wiped his eyes with his apron.</p>
        <p>"Yes," he said sadly, "the poor boy is surely crazy."

      <div type="chapter" n="XIII">
        <p>Sidney Long told me, in primary instructions about my call boy job, that I was to remain in the front office, after finishing with the carriers, until somebody of the business office staff should come to take over. The earliest arrival, he said, would usually be between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
        <p>If I got all my carriers out on a good schedule, I had from five-thirty or, at latest, six, until that uncertain time of arrival of the first business office employee, by myself, in the big business office. Upon making sure that every carrier was out, I took over the front office, turned up the lights, unlocked the front door, and sat down at one of the desks, usually Mr. Long's, to read the morning paper.</p>
        <p>A hundred Eagles had been stacked under the front counter as soon as the last edition had begun running. One of my Jobs was to hand these out, at a nickel apiece, to early-stirring salesmen who were catching trains or arriving from trains. Five to a dozen copies was a fair morning's business, which was an accommodation service to the public. I was interested in the tired men who made up this early morning clientele, and speculated upon their way of life, and why they had to be up so early, at their age. When they were willing, I talked with them, and heard of the great world that stretched away to Kansas City, St. Louis, and even to Chicago and Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>On the first morning of my service, the first person to arrive and sit at a desk in the large business office was a plump, red-haired Scotchman, about 26 years old, who gave me a smile and a nod. I rose from my desk, looked at the clock, which said eight-fifteen,
        <pb n="112" />and, heading for the front door, said to the gentleman, "Well, you'll take over now, will you? Mr. Long said the first comer would take care of the counter and I'm to leave.""Yes, I'll do that," said the redhead, with a smile and a tone that sounded slightly patronizing.</p>
        <p>Exactly the sane thing happened, the exchange of words being only slightly varied, for the first three mornings. On the third day a special delivery letter awaited me at lunch. It was from Sidney Long, and directed me to see him at once.</p>
        <p>After my last class, at 4:45 p.m., I bicycled over to the Eagle, and stood before Mr. Long.</p>
        <p>I noticed that he had a wild light in his pale blue eyes, and he screamed when he talked to me.</p>
        <p>"Good God, how dumb are you, to be in college?" he shouted. I stood mute.</p>
        <p>"Three days you have worked for me, and three times you have told the publisher to do your job! God Almighty, where do you come from with all your recommendations?</p>
        <p>"I found out today that you've been bossing Mr. Murdock around, and he owns this place and all of us who work here!"I guessed the situation.</p>
        <p>"You told me to give over to the first one who came to the office in the morning," I said, not quailing any more than could be helped. "I follow your instructions. If that was Mr. Murdock, how was I to know it? He doesn't wear his name on his forehead.""Great God, is there a young man with brains enough to go to college who doesn't know Mr. Murdock by sight?" he asked, and went on roaring so that his voice carried all over the business office. Each time he uttered the name Murdock he softened, mouthed the syllables lovingly and with great respect, and, I thought, actually
        <pb n="113" />bowed his uncombed head, as Catholics do when the name of Jesus is mentioned.</p>
        <p>Long told me to follow him, led me to a plain desk in the midst of the business office workers, and addressed The Persons:"Mr. Murdock," and the words flowed like Olympian honey from his lips, "may I ask your permission to present Mr. Driscoll, a young man from Friends, who....""Why, hello, Charlie!" said the Jovial young Scotchman. "Your father and my father were great friends, and I've always wanted to know you. If I'd known it was a Driscoll at that desk these mornings, I'd have gone over and talked a while. I'm awfully sorry I didn't recognize you. Sit down."Sidney Long's lower jaw had dripped so far that you could see his decayed dentition, back to the wisdom teeth. Murdock didn't even look at him.</p>
        <p>"Yes, I remember that your father used to hunt quail on our farm when I was a little boy," I said.</p>
        <p>We were off on reminiscences of old Marsh Murdock, founder of the paper, and my father, whose continued active farming existence surprised Marcellus. The elder Murdock had been dead several years. Marcellus had taken over the job of publisher for the estate, and his brother Victor, who had not taken public speaking at Lewis Academy, was nominally editor, but actually engaged in the political life.</p>
        <p>When we had finished our talk, Sidney bowed low and said, "Thank you, Mr. Murr-dock," in the tone one uses when coaxing a little puppy to lap up his milk, and we went back to the Long alcove.</p>
        <p>During my long association with the Eagle I often heard Sidney Long bellowing at carriers, solicitors and other employes.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="114" />Never again did he speak to me except in the most friendly and pleasant terms, and in a modulated tone of voice.</p>
        <p>__________It was, and, I suppose, still is, the practice among Quakers of our sect at Friends to dispense with titles of honor and courtesy, insofar as that was or is practicable in the modern world. Those professors who were really Quaker called their students not Miss Yungmeyer or Mr. Holmes, but Elsie Yungmeyer and Claud Holmes, using first and last names together.</p>
        <p>This was pleasing to ay ear, as were the thee and thou used at table, but not in classrooms.</p>
        <p>I learned the peculiar use of thee, which is not spoken among these people as it is in grammars or in the Bible. "Will thee have sugar?" seemed to me more friendly and infernal than the Biblical "Wilt thou?" I used the Quaker speech at table at Aunt Lida's, and fell ineeasily [sic] with the plain and unpretentious Quaker ways.</p>
        <p>During the first summer after my first college year at 1616, Mrs. Lyons had the little gray cottage moved away on rollers, and, in its place, put up a solid, roomy, unadorned two-story house, more modern, comfortable and spacious than the other house.</p>
        <p>I was assigned a room on the same terms as before, but a better room, with more light and air. Aunt Lida, never sentimental, never soft, was always capable. Her Quaker faith was as nearly fanatical as I have ever seen that faith expressed. But who was I to criticize fanaticism? I could toss a cork at twice two dozen of my relatives who were at least equally fanatical in their Catholic faith. And neither Aunt Lida nor anybody else at Friends ever held my Catholicism against me. Well, there may have been a couple of exceptions. They were amusing, rather than disturbing, or would have been had my sense of humor been just a little stronger.</p>
        <p>Early in a semester course entitled "The Spanish in America,"
        <pb n="115" />the mild-mannered, scholarly, bewhiskered Dr. W. E. True blood, who never became excited about anything, was lecturing interestingly about the kind of people who conquered the Incas and the Aztecs.</p>
        <p>Now, there were present in that time and at that place a brother and sister, known to the students respectively as Red and Ma. They came from some remote Quaker settlement in the short grass, and were zealous in the faith, tireless in spreading the Gospel, and regardless of the comical comments of their more wordly fellow-students.</p>
        <p>They both lived to carry the Gospel to the heathen and Catholics in backward lands, in several parts of the world, and, I am sure, justified themselves in the eyes of the Judge whom they constantly envisioned as a scourge of all non-Quakers.</p>
        <p>Let me add, before the ink becomes too dry, that they were the only two of that particular stripe I ever met among the gentle folk of the Society of Friendsï¿½well, almost the only two.</p>
        <p>When our lecturer said something about the civilizing influence of the Catholic church, up shot the hand of stout Red Shortgrass.</p>
        <p>"But Professor," he drawled, "I always thought that the Catholics were awfully immoral."I was more sensitive to religious prejudice in those days than I have been in later years, also more quick-tempered.</p>
        <p>I was on my feet before the Professor had time to make a reply, and with a polite request that the good Doctor permit me to handle Red, I lit into him. During the half hour that was left of the class period, I held the floor, talking rapidly and without self-consciousness. There was little in the talk in specific defense of the Catholic church, and much about the evils of bigotry.</p>
        <p>When the bell signalled [sic] the end of the period, Dr. Trueblood was smiling broadly into his whiskers. He dismissed us with the remark, "I think this is going to be one of our most interesting
        <pb n="116" />The students had never before seen a student, and a new one at that, take over the class without permission and devote half a period to a passionate lecture, delivered in anger. It was contra mores, but the students liked it. Red was unpopular with his classmates anyway, and to hear him get such a public dressing down amused and entertained the customers.</p>
        <p>The only other incident involving prejudice was trivial, so far as I was concerned. I was nominated for some position in the Y.M.C.A. Cabinet. There was brief consultation, and I was asked to leave the room during voting. When I left a student whom I never knew well called attention to a rule which made Catholics ineligible to hold office. The others knew of the rule, but urged that it be waived. The ardent one held his ground, and delivered an anti-Catholic tirade. He was right as to the rule, and I was ruled out. Not that I cared, since I had too many extra-curricular jobs already.</p>
        <p>I did not hear the details of that meeting until years later, when the ardent one showed up in the news as the first and only graduate of our alma mater to go to prison. Then my old friend, John Stanley, who fought my battle in the heated conference, told me the details, which were corroborated by others,In day-to-day contacts, everybody respected the religious beliefs and practices of everybody else. Next to me in chapel seating was a young lady of such firm Methodist convictions that she would not enter a theater, dance, or play cards. Her closest friends did all of these things, and respected her determination to abide by her convictions. Dr. William Pearson, aged instructor in the History of Israel, was, we thought, unduly gruff with the Christian Scientist when she suggested that the angels mentioned in some passage of Scripture might be beautiful thoughts. The Doctor was indignant at such
        <pb n="117" />heresy, as he viewed it, and denounced such doctrine as old-fashioned and long ago given up by intelligent folk. The students would have held the Doctor in greater esteem had he merely said, "I don't go for that doctrine, nor do I teach it. But if it fits with your religious beliefs, I wish you happiness with it."My initial outburst in the case of Red gave me a certain prestige, since there was no telling when I might burst forth. When, in the course of the Spanish in America studies, for instance, a question of Catholic doctrine arose, I was always asked to expound it. Thus, it became my duty to give doctrinal slants on the Virgin Birth, so often confused with the Immaculate Conception, the Infallibility of the Pope, and other items theretofore obscure to my colleagues.</p>
        <p>__________Besides the half dozen roomer-boarders at Aunt Lida's, there were generally about twenty students, faculty members, and an occasional non-collegian, at luncheon. This was the only boarding house a near the campus that set a large table, and a hot lunch was more desirable than a cold one, even with the green tomato pie added.</p>
        <p>A part-time student in the Bible school who lunched with us was a young man who wore a Roman collar and a black clerical suit, such as is often worn by an Episcopal minister. He was a deacon of the Protestant Episcopal church, and had charge of a small chapel on the West Side. He was of an old and honored family. His father was a noted and widely respected missionary among the Indians on a Northern reservation.</p>
        <p>This young man was distinctly the black sheep of a fine religious family. He seemed doomed to be a deacon all his life, since he was dumb, and could not pass necessary examinations for the priesthood. Let us call him Lester, rather than use the
        <pb n="118." />honored name to which he contributed no credit.</p>
        <p>The story told among churchmen, afterwards at least partly corroborated in the press, was that the great missionary was serving the Indian flock well when he discovered that this scapegrace son had been populating the whole reservation with half-breed papooses. Brokenhearted, the father sent the culprit to this place, remote from the Mission, and urged him to go to school at the Quaker college, and try to pass his examinations. Meantime, the small chapel was something to keep the boy busy and to maintain him in a church atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Lester was a perfect Malaprop conversationalist. He cracked many a wisecrack at table that drew no smile from anyone except a good-looking brown-eyed girl from the Music School of the university.</p>
        <p>The young lady, who was so unstable that she laughed or cried in public at the slightest provocation, was much taken with the foolish young man with the Roman collar. She played up to him, and was rewarded by tender glances and the best conversation the young man knew how to make.</p>
        <p>Lester, hearing that I was winning oratorical contests, asked me to write a sermon for him. He said he had an awful time writing a sermon, and therefore was forced to rely chiefly upon sermons long ago delivered by his father and other ministers. He would like to have a new sermon to read to his small flock. I asked him for a subject, and he could only reply, "Well, I always talk about the love of God. Love and God are two words that people like, so I just talk all the time about the love of God. Maybe you could turn out a fifteen-minute sermon on that." I didn't.</p>
        <p>During vacation, I met Brown Eyes in Riverside park, picknicking [sic] with her mother and relatives. She came to the walk to talk with me, seemed violently excited about nothing that I could discern,
        <pb n="119" />and suddenly started speaking gibberish, her face changing color rapidly while she went through queer and meaningless gyrations. Her mother led her away. When I left the poor girl was laid out on the grass, unconscious,"She gets that way," was all her mother said.</p>
        <p>The papers told how Lester went to a cemetery and shot himself on his father's grave.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XIV">
        <p>It was pleasant to sit in the parlor of the quiet Quaker boarding house, with large windows looking out upon a well-kept lawn, shaded by giant maples, studying or reading the paper or a book, while waiting for dinner.</p>
        <p>Once, lacking a library book, I looked in the modest bookcase that formed part of the inexpensive parlor furniture. There was a large history of Quaker martyrs, some devotional manuals, two hymn books, and, to my surprise, a dozen or more text-books of grade and high school, inscribed with the name of Lyons. I forget the first name, but perhaps that is just as well. I shall call it Harry. Harry Lyons, 1616 University avenue, with the name of the high or prep school. At that time there was a prep school in connection with the university, so I suppose that was the one attended by Harry. The books covered several years of schooling.</p>
        <p>A faculty member who was an old resident and a constant boarder came into the room where I had been alone, looking at the books.</p>
        <p>"I would advise you not to let Aunt Lida see you reading those books," said the professor, kindly. "Nobody ever disturbs them."I hastily put the "U.S. History" back into the case, saying, "Was the student who owned them a son who has died?""Well, that would be a hard question to answer. I see that the diners are arriving. Some other time."I had talked with Aunt Lida about her history, origins, schooling, during off hours, when I wished to become acquainted.</p>
        <p>She had never mentioned having had a child. I was interested now in this mystery. I made inquiries among veteran Quakers of the university community, and learned this much of the story.</p>
        <p>Lida was a righteous woman, also inflexible, tyrannical. She had reduced her husband, Clark, to the status of Milquetoast and a
        <pb n="121" />potato peeler when, many years ago, he had committed some action that she considered indiscreet. Demotion to the ranks took place while he was critically ill, whether or not as a result of the indiscretion, I never learned. There was a brief estrangement, and Clark was admitted to participation in the household affairs on a basis of perpetual servitude only after he had signed the property over to Lida, and had agreed to take orders from her.</p>
        <p>Harry was a good student, but extremely unhappy in his righteous home. He was nagged by his mother. He pitied his father. Finally, he was caught smocking a cigaret, and such severe sanctions were imposed that he left home during the night and never came back. Well, very nearly never.</p>
        <p>Reflecting upon the situation, Lida decided that she needed her son. Perhaps he had not been a bad boy. The worst thing he had ever done was to smoke. She put a personal advertisement in one of the Wichita papers asking Harry to come home so that all might be forgiven. No result.</p>
        <p>Years had passed. Harry would be grown now. Lida was lonesome. So was Clark.</p>
        <p>I was told that Lida, during the years of my residence in her house, was spending sixty dollars a month in personal ads in papers in distant parts, asking Harry to come home. She had, started during the first year of his absence, spending a few dollars every month for these notices, and now was increasing the item in her budget at the rate of ten or twelve dollars a year. Friends missionaries in various parts of the world received the copy and the money and inserted the ads.</p>
        <p>Because the boy had shown interest in the Pacific Northwest, some paper in that part of the country carried the mother's plea
        <pb n="122" />in classified ads at least once a week. But, as the appropriation grew with the loneliness of the aging heart, newspapers in Africa, Cuba, India and Japan, where missions flourished, carried the notice from time to time.</p>
        <p>Missionary friends who received occasional donations from the boarding house income were exhorted by Aunt Lida to look out for Harry, and, if sighted, to report immediately, charges collect. Mission papers and pamphlets, with occasional pulpit announcements in far parts of the world, related the mother's plea to her missing son. Results had been negative.</p>
        <p>This was the status of the case when I was a boarder at 1616. Rather than break the continuity in order to keep within the chronological limits of my book, I shall carry the story to its conclusion here.</p>
        <p>Clark dropped dead of heart disease while performing some heavy work around the house, a few years after I left school.</p>
        <p>Lida, whose face long had worn that almost expressionless mask of the woman who has fought herself into sexlessness and cold righteousness, was slowly bending under the strain of her burdened conscience. It was too late to make amends to the hapless husband. She prayed much in Meeting, and doubled her advertising appropriation. No considerable area of the globe was left uncovered by her plea.</p>
        <p>She closed the boarding house and married Professor Trueblood, the same who had permitted me to carry the banner of Rome in the history class. Trueblood was an old man now, and had not accumulated worldly goods in his years of faithful service to the cause of Quaker education. He had known young Harry. Assured of a competence, he would retire from active teaching and devote his time to directing world-wide search for the missing son.</p>
        <p>Harry would be a mature man now. If living, he might even 
        <pb n="123" />have a family. What a blessed comfort it would be, said Aunt Lida, if he should drive up some day in a car, with wife and children! Grandchildren were such a blessing in one's old age. Yes, even though they should smoke cigarets, she would welcome them home. Professor Trueblood died, and Lida was alone. She tottered to Meeting on the Lord's Day and mumbled prayers for her one great wish.</p>
        <p>She died, very old.</p>
        <p>After the funeral, the will was read to a group in which was no one of Aunt Lida's blood.</p>
        <p>Most of those concerned were amazed at the size of the fortune the frugal maker of green tomato pies had accumulated and preserved through good times and bad. Everything was to be taken over by trustees. A set amount per month was to be expended for advertising for Harry, until he should be found or his demise ascertained.</p>
        <p>The trust should hold the funds for a number of years that should compass Harry's maximum probable lifetime. If, in the meantime, Harry should be found, the entire fund should be turned over to him. Otherwise, to Friends university.</p>
        <p>Local papers carried an account of the funeral and will. A few days later a middle-aged business man appeared at the office of the trustees, satisfactorily identified himself as Harry, and took over the estate. Interviewed by the papers, the brisk gentleman revealed that he had a family and a successful business in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>Yes, he had known about the search for him, ever since it began. He received a Wichita newspaper regularly, and in it had read of his mother's passing.</p>
        <p>Why had he never communicated with his mother?</p>
        <p>Simply because he didn't want to. His mother's treatment of him and of his father scarcely warranted any interest in her on his
        <pb n="124" />part. Thank you for your trouble, gentlemen. And the long-lost son was back on a train for the Northwest.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XV">
        <p>John Stanley was a member of a class two years ahead of mine. He was generally regarded as First Man on Campus, brilliant in his studies, prominent in many extracurricular activities, handsome, a good speaker, leader of student movements, Number One Athlete, favorite of faculty and students alike. John was of a Quaker farm family, and had come to the big building on University avenue as a grade pupil in a practice school, long since abolished. He had done extra work in the Bible schoolunder Doctor Pearson..</p>
        <p>Besides all of his campus honors, John had the best paper route in town. It was not the longest, not the best-paying, and it had not the largest number of subscribers. But it was compact, requiring only about sixteen blocks of walking, north and south, for delivery of papers. Add to this, however, three blocks across, multiplied by four horizontal streets, and you have a total of twenty-eight blocks to be served. The cross-blocks had to be traversed twice, going and coming from the north-south streets, so you add it up to forty blocks of travel, afoot, with a pack on your back. Distance from the newspaper plant to point of starting was important, and this, in John's case, was only six blocks. Since this distance was done on a bicycle, it didn't count as labor.</p>
        <p>During the many years that John had carried this route he had built it up, by regular solicitation and good service, until almost every home on the route was a customer. It was the cost solid route in town, made so by its courteous, efficient carrier.</p>
        <p>John was my best friend among the upperclassmen. One day toward the spring of his graduation, he said, "Charlie, how would you like to have my route? I'll have to be giving it up soon, so as to prepare for final exams. I was talking to Sidney Long about it, and he is
        <pb n="126" />agreeable to having you take it over. Of course, there will be no money transaction between you and me, but you will have to put up a deposit of thirty dollars with the Eagle to guarantee payment for papers." If he had offered me a house and lot I could not have been so happy. I was asked to see Mr. Long. In a long sermon about the virtues of the Burdock family, the circulation manager impressed upon me the honor that was mine in being offered the best route in town without being required to serve a novitiate or apprenticeship. I told him I would begin learning the route immediately and would arrange for the deposit.</p>
        <p>I already was familiar with the fact that the route paid the carrier six dollars a week, more or less, if he were careful about starts, stops, solicitations and collections. Increase of two dollars a week in my income would make me independently wealthy!</p>
        <p>I had experience in carrying routes. Long had been grooming me for a career as an Eagle man, without my knowing it. I had learned the rates on paper in my work of distributing starts and stops. I had gone along with a dozen different boys to learn their routes. I had acted as substitute carrier on many routes. It was a joy to set out early in the morning with John, the good companion, and to talk of many things in the still hours before dawn.</p>
        <p>"I'm going out to India as a missionary teacher," John told me. I'm leaving Wichita the day after commencement, and you won't see me for a long time. No, I'm not going to marry the girl."The last statement was a shock. The entire student body took for granted that John and the girl whom he had been courting for years would be married at commencement time. I asked no questions. We walked a block in silence, I throwing one side of the street, John the other.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="127" />Said John: "Charlie, I'm going out to do something or other in the Name of Jesus Christ. I've been studying religion and the Bible for so many years that I ought to be ready to be a bishop of London when I graduate. And I don't, in my inner self, believe that such a man as Jesus Christ ever lived."This was a knockout. We talked in low tones, so as not to wake customers. I said that I had complete faith in the teachings of Christianity, with no doubts on any subject of importance. I didn't believe that the snake talked or that the bears went out and ate up the children for yelling "Baldhead!" at a holy man. But these were children's tales; true in that they once taught a truth, in parable or fairy tale form, to primitive peoples.</p>
        <p>We spent many mornings discussing these matters, and I concluded that John's declaration of unfaith or unbelief was in part a delayed collegiate reaction to classroom philosophy and religion, often found in sophomores, and partly an emotional reaction of despair that might owe its origin to the sudden break with the girl.</p>
        <p>I thought a good deal about how I was going to get the thirty dollars for the bond, as the deposit was generally called. I suppose they called it that to make the boys feel more like responsible business men.</p>
        <p>I couldn't ask Mother for it. She didn't have that much money, and if she should come by it she would have to think first about Van's needs, which seemed never to grow less.</p>
        <p>During my time in college, up to the appearance of this problem, I had often eaten Sunday dinner at Miss Fanny's, where I had done my final stretch as a waiter. As tine drew near for my taking over the route, I approached Miss Fanny for serious talk, on a Sunday afternoon. I
        <pb n="128" />told her the whole story and made a business proposition. Would she make me a loan of sixty days duration, thirty dollars plus six percent per annum?</p>
        <p>She consented, and the note was drawn up in due form. I borrowed for the first time in my life. It was also the last time, until, a few years ago, I bought a home with a mortgage attached.</p>
        <p>I carried my route through that summer, held several jobs, some of then in the business end of the Eagle, saved a little money, and did a lot of studying and general reading.</p>
        <p>My eyes were going bad, however, day by day. Also, I had trouble with teeth, evidenced by violent toothaches and swollen jaws. I did not trouble Mother about these things, but determined to let them drift until I finished school and earned money.</p>
        <p>I used campho-phenique (carbolic acid and camphor, 50-50) to plug the aching teeth, and went on studying in the evenings. I used some sort of drops to soothe aching eyes, especially the left eye, which had been hit by a hard snowball thrown by Karl Kirby, at Riverside School, with the admonition, "Take that, you damn old Kafflick!" Later a baby had stabbed me in the same eye with a pair of scissors. I have been an active anti-scissors-for-babies man ever since.</p>
        <p>Some evenings it was necessary for me to sit in my room at Aunt Lida's for hours without light, to rest the bad eye. On one such evening, before turning on the light, I picked up a bottle and poured a liberal quantity of the contents into the bad eye.</p>
        <p>I had picked the campho-phenique! I rushed downstairs in horrible pain, told Aunt Lida what had happened. She called her doctor instantly, got excellent telephone service, asked her question briefly, and got a quick answer.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="129" />"Pour a bottle of cream into it, slowly."Fortunately, Aunt Lida had a bottle of that precious liquid, of which she was always sparing in her cooking and table supplies. She laid me out and poured. There was immediate relief, but the eye swelled completely shut, burned intensely for a week, and yielded slowly to treatment by an oculist. The sight, already impaired, was further damaged, and a handicap from which I had suffered long became a definite threat of blindness.</p>
        <p>As a carrier, I was no great success. I got my papers out early, made fairly rapid and accurate delivery, and made friends with regular customers. But I was lax in matters of solicitation and collections. I did not like solicitation. Then, as now, I shrunk from asking people to buy. If the prospective customer said no, that was enough for me. One of my fundamental failings is that I always take no for an answer if it is offered. If I have wares or services that the customer wants, he should know his wants better than I.</p>
        <p>As to collections, which should be made thoroughly every Saturday, mine fell behind because I had most Saturdays taken with other jobs, with work on the college paper, or with quick bicycle trips to the farm to see Mother and to do farm work. I had to turn in the money for my week's papers every Saturday; no delays brooded. So I would collect enough to pay mu [sic] bill, and a little more, and let the rest go, hoping to findtime for it next Saturday, or on evenings after school.</p>
        <p>The price of the paper, daily (except Mondays) and Sunday, was ten cents a week. Any loss by reason of deadbeats or move-outs was the carrier's loss. I had particularly bad luck with deadbeats, because of my neglect in close collecting. I had a few Negro families on my route. Once in a while one of these families would move. Someone would be at
        <pb n="130" />the door waiting for me, early in the morning, to pay the bill up to date and order the paper stopped. I never lost a dime on Negroes.</p>
        <p>Orthodox Jews, of whom I had a few, were equally good pay. If they fell behind or I neglected to collect, I never worried. The lady of the house would be waiting, just before the Jewish New Year, to square accounts.</p>
        <p>When Stanley turned the route over to me he told me of the families that paid promptly, of those to be watched, and of certain houses or apartments that were always bad pay, no matter how many tines they changed tenants.</p>
        <p>John showed me a very humble shack on the Santa Fe tracks. "A family named Moore lives here," he said. "Never bother to collect. They pay when they have the money, and sometimes that's not for several weeks. They will stop you some Sunday morning and pay up. Honest as Ben Franklin, but poor. The old man works on the railroad, and just now is out of a job."That family never paid me a dime. They were more than four dollars in my debt (a huge sum in my small business), when the lady of the house told me that they had given up hope of paying and asked me to stop the paper.</p>
        <p>I suffered two major business disasters and one personal injury during my carrier days. I tossed a huge Sunday paper toe vigorously, and it went through the largest plate glass window on my route. Why any architect should put such a large window, and of such expensive glass, in so small a cottage, I never have figured out.</p>
        <p>My customer at that address was a nice fellow, J. P. Weigand, who attended our church. He was sympathetic when I offered to pay for the damage, but he had to accept my offer. Otherwise he would have to
        <pb n="131" />pay, and he merely rented the house.</p>
        <p>I carried his paper free for the rest of my carrying career, and paid him the balance of the twenve [sic] dollars in cash. On a collection day I entered a small candy-cigar store, and while waiting for the proprietor to come with the dime, leaned on a showcase, looking at candy I couldn't afford.</p>
        <p>The top glass, which was thin and frail of construction, cracked. The proprietor immediately insisted upon restitution, and I had another paper to carry free until I had paid all. I have since learned that I didn't owe anything, as a showcase is for show, and if it's too shoddy to bear the weight of a leaning customer, that is the misfortune of the company that has the insurance. The damage there tires four dollars.</p>
        <p>On a Saturday morning after my route was delivered I decided to go out to the farm for the day. I had delivered early, so as to be home for breakfast. Mother always cooked something special and heavy for me on such occasions. A stack of pancakes, with bacon and eggs and a hunk of apple pie made a nourishing breakfast for one who had been working hard and eating little.</p>
        <p>A storm was coming up, and I knew I would have to walk through the muddy miles, leading the bicycle, unless I could beat it. I put on the speed while I still had suburban cement sidewalk, along Harry street, which was about the south limit of town.</p>
        <p>While making the highest speed I could get out of the machine, I failed to notice that the Santa Fe railway had not provided the plank crossing for pedestrians, as required by law, but had left the rails of a two-track road standing starkly up in their depressed bed, a menace to foot traffic and death to bikes. Had I been watching the road ahead, as I should, all would have been well.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="132" />My front wheel struck the first rail with a mighty impact.</p>
        <p>I went through the air, landing across the farther rail. When I awoke I could not move my legs, both of which had struck the rail between knee and hip. My glasses were broken, clothes ruined. The front wheel of the bicycle was behind the rear wheel, and the massive frame, adapted from one of the early makes, was bent double. The front tire was a rag.</p>
        <p>I was in great pain, but realized that I must start removing myself from the track before a train should overtake me. I dragged myself by the elbows, off the tracks, and by slow inches across the street. It was still dark. I shouted for help when I reached the front yard of a house, but there was no reply.</p>
        <p>By dint of mighty effort, I pulled myself up two steps, and, lying prostrate by the front door, pounded on it with my fist and cried aloud for help. I must have been there, in terrible pain, for half an hour, before someone cane to the door.</p>
        <p>"We heard you, all right," said the old lady, "but we thought you was burglars, so we figgered to wait till it got light."I asked them to telephone my home, They brought coffee, where I lay on the floor, and the old gentleman cut my trousers from my swollen legs to give me a little surcease of pain. John came in the roadwagon, hoisted me into it, and drove me home.</p>
        <p>I was away from work and from school two weeks. I had to buy a new bicycle frame and some parts, but was able to salvage such items as the seat, handlebars, rear wheel and coaster brake, which cut down the cost. Van was visiting the family a few weeks later, and wanted to get a friend of his to sue the railroad company for maintaining a trap, but I refused to do anything about it. I was violating an ordinance against riding on the sidewalk, and felt guilty about it.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="133" />The new bicycle was stolen from its place at the curb, outside the Eagle pressroom, soon after I got it. It was while I was waiting for my papers that the wheel disappeared. I delivered my papers without bicycle aid that morning, but as soon as the stores opened I began making a personal search of all bicycle shops. I found my precious vehicle hidden under a wide table In the rear of a shop on East Douglas avenue, dragged it out in the presence of the proprietor, and defied him to take it away from me. He knew, of course, that he stood to lose as a receiver of stolen property. If I had not been so prompt in my search, he would have interchanged parts, painted here and there, and I would have no bicycle.</p>
        <p>The fence told me the name of the thief. He was a drunken pressman at the Eagle. Fence got out his motorcycle, I climbed on behind, and we chugged to Thief's home, a shack in the Linwood park area, near the south edge of town. Thief was not at home.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, I hounded Thief until he was fired from his job and moved from the house in which he had been living. The house happened to be on my route homeward when I was going to the farm. I never failed to stop in and ask for Mr. Thief, always being informed by a pale and frightened wife or daughter that he was not at home. I bought a heavy padlock and chain, and never thereafter left the vehicle at the curb unlocked.</p>
        <p>It was about this time, too, that I was chopping kindling in the back yard of the farmhouse, and suffered one of the common injuries of farm life. A stick of kindling, halved by a vigorous axe blow, hit the defective left eye with terrific force. I had another setback in my studies. Friendly fellow-students read the day's assignments and lessons to me, finding the exercise good for their own studies. They
        <pb n="134" />wrote say daily paper work at my dictation, and took dictation for editorial matter in the college paper. This accident was annoying for a month, and once more advanced me on the road to blindness.</p>

        <p>It is customary in almost every American college having a student publication, to issue, once a year, a hoax number. It may be called the hoax number, edition, issue, the yellow edition, or any one of many names. But in design it follows a pattern. It burlesques the campus, faculty, students and everything within reach, printing as if true the most preposterous stories.</p>
        <p>I invented the hoax number, originated the idea, wrote and published the first such college publication in history. It was known as the Yellow Number of University Life, and a copy is before me. The date of issue is November twenty-fifth, 1910.</p>
        <p>In those days the Wichita Eagle was edited by a young man named Garland P. Ferrell, son of a pioneer Kansan who had made a modest fortune in cattle and real estate. Garland had been graduated from Harvard, and had worked on Hearst newspapers, particularly in Boston. He had been chief of bureau for the Hearst news service in Boston. He was an artist in the Hearst form of yellow Journalism of that time.</p>
        <p>The elder Ferrell was concerned about his brilliant son's apparent ambition to drink all the available liquor in New England. Being an innocent and rather unsophisticated gentleman, he reasoned that he could cure the boy of this ambition if he could by any means transfer him to dry Kansas. Let's go back and out quotes on that "dry."Papa Ferrell made a proposition to the Murdocks. He would get for them the best editor that they had ever employed, and better than that by far, his son who had made good in the East. The Murdocks, as a matter of fact, had never had a newspaperman of any important experience on the paper. They were interested, but could not pay more than the
        <pb n="136" />customary rate of twenty-five dollars a week. Papa arranged to pay the Murdocks out of his pocket an equal sum, and the Eagle would pay Garland the munificent salary of fifty dollars a week.</p>
        <p>Papa sent the propostion [sic] along to Garland, with the additional inducement of free rent in one of a string of Ferrell two-story houses on East Pine street. Garland received the employment offer through proper channels, and did not know, for a long time, that his father was paying half his salary. He thought the Murdocks had gone mad with generosity when he saw the other items on the payroll and realized that he was far and away the highest-salaried man the paper had ever employed.</p>
        <p>Garland was a brilliant editor and a good writer. These were qualifications the Eagle did not need and did not appreciate. A badly written and badly edited paper, as Victor Murdock explained to the hopeful young editor from the East, sold just as well as the best newspaper in the world, bound in vellum, would sell, in Wichita and surrounding circulation territory.</p>
        <p>Circulation, explained The Murdock, had nothing to do with quality in this town, but was entirely dependent upon train schedules. The Eagle had the daily newspaper circulation of a vast empire, stretching as far east as Emporia, where there was one subscriber, despite the efforts of William Allen White to cover the two with his Emporia Gazette, west to the Colorado line, north beyond Hutchinson, and south into the Texas Panhandle. All this because the Eagle was published early in the morning, and Santa Fe trains ran south and southwest early enough to get the mail edition all over the Southwest in time for breakfast. As a matter of fact, there was no news of the day in that mail edition, which went to press long before midnight. The customers didn't know that, nor did they care.</p>
        <p>The so-called competition was the Wichita Beacon, an evening paper
        <pb n="137" />owned by a financier named Hagney. Its circulation was negligible, and it was a rule of the Eagle that the Beacon was never to be mentioned in the Eagle, no matter what the provocation.</p>
        <p>As a demonstration of the power of the Eagle to maintain circulation without reference to quality, Murdock ordered Ferrell to eliminate all cuts for a period of three months. Ferrell protested that this would ruin any paper. "Not this one," replied the Boss, "and since it costs money to have cuts made, this experiment will mean more money for the Murdocks."The art was dropped. Circulation held steady. Then the management ordered all country correspondents suspended for an indefinite period.</p>
        <p>Here, thought the innocent young Harvard man, is the end of this honored sheet. Not a subscriber was lost, and the Murdock till was richer by the amount formerly paid to the correspondents.</p>
        <p>"You see," explained The Murdock, "we need a smart editor with big city ideas at fifty dollars a week as badly as we need a hole in our hat."Thereupon, according to his story to me, years later, Mr. Ferrell determined to cease worrying about getting out a quality newspaper. He tried the experiment of filling the two editorial columns with stuff clipped from other papers. Nobody complained. Garland got a quart of whiskey and a pair of newspaper scissors, pasted up his editorials in an hour each day, and spent the rest of the time smoking his pipe, talking to the old fogeys and crackpots who visited him with schemes to reform the world, and consuming the liquor which he had no difficulty in obtaining in "dry" Kansas.</p>
        <p>It was about this time that Henry J. Allen bought the Beacon. Henry had been secretary to an unimportant governor by the name of Stanley. The secretary was so much smarter than the governor that he
        <pb n="138" />eventually became one of the most famous governors in the history of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Allen began a series of crusades, most important of which was a drive for enforcement of the prohibition laws. He lined the church crowd on his side, and increased his circulation at the Eagle's expense. He won a city election, put into office &amp; scared and weak-kneed set of politicians, and prodded his henchmen to spectacular action in closingsaloons and imprisoning offenders against the prohibition laws.</p>
        <p>Here Ferrell swung into action. He loved a fight. He could not mention the Beacon by name, which was a handicap. The Eagle owned the Court House crowd, now pitted against the City Hall crowd, and clinging to the Eagle's protection against ousters and elections then looming.</p>
        <p>By means of spies from the Courthouse, the Eagle uncovered plenty of dirt in City Hall. Among the discoveries was a so-called hidden room, in which all manner of iniquity was supposed to be perpetrated. The Eagle broke the story of hidden room all over page one, with diagrams, pictures, photographs, affidavits, and editorial indictments brilliantly written by the delighted Mr. Ferrell.</p>
        <p>Ferrell had a style of his own, scholarly, picturesque, philippic, and he tossed the short, incisive and accusative phrase most effectively. His writing was unsigned, but marked indubitably by his ringing style. The town was a little more than agog. It was agogger than it had even been theretofore, and each day's Eagle supplied another needle to drive the subscribers on to super-agoggery. I could not deliver my papers early enough to suit the customers.</p>
        <p>Housewives, who are always described as staid, were on their front porches, in nightclothes, waiting for the paper. The earliest-to-work laborers, of whom I had a few on Santa Fe avenue, wanted to read the
        <pb n="139" />latest developments in the town's scandal before setting out for work.</p>
        <p>Henry Allen was retreating to strategic positions previously prepared, whence he sent forth clouds of poison gas to embarrass his enemy. He tormented the Murdocks where he knew it would hurt. Every Murdock spoke of The Family with much the same tone of worship as Sidney Long used in mentioning Mister Mur-r-r-dock. Allen attacked The Family, poking fun at old Marsh Murdock, a supposedly sainted character, dead now some years and sitting on the right hand of someone ranking no lower than the Archangel Michael.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, the old fellow, who established The Eagle in 1672, was no saint while on earth, had a tough time writing a simple declarative sentence, and lived and died by the circumstance that he got there first arid never had any competition. Allen told all this, and more.</p>
        <p>Now The Family was mad. For the first time in history it took notice of the opposition. On page one of a Sunday edition appeared a three-column cartoon, entitled "The Jackal." In the crude chalk-plate strokes of the staff cartoonist, who was a bricklayer, and a good one, a jackal, with the face of Henry Allen, carefully traced, was digging into a grave.</p>
        <p>Just a little farther southwest, the shooting would have started in the streets.</p>
        <p>In those days the three extra papers handed out to each carrier for possible new starts or miscount became an assured source of income to the extent of fifteen cents a day. Persons hurrying through the dark streets, spotting a carrier, would ask for a paper. It was against the rules for a carrier to sell a paper thus, but they all did it if they could. In my case, having been a call boy, delivering papers to the carriers and working
        <pb n="140" />close with Bill Newman, the counter, I always had a few extras, beyond the quota of three. Bill's friendship with me would not permit my having to come all the way back to the office on my bicycle for papers for the last three or four houses on my route, in case of shortage. So I got a nice handful of extras, and usually sold them all to casual customers who wanted to know the latest news in the city-county scandal.</p>
        <p>In order to keep the pot boiling, Ferrell needled the sheriff into raiding Callahan's Dump, home and depot of a notorious criminal, long operating under protection of the police. Callahan was well known to all peace officers of Kansas and Nebraska as a train robber, bank robber, post office robber, murderer, petty thief, dope runner and liquor runner, he was guilty of many other crimes, but these were of common knowledge. He circulated among the citizens of Wichita in complete safety. Every cop knew him, and knew, also, that he was not to be molested, under pain of instant dismissal, with appropriate disgrace, and possible execution. So the sheriff, without knowledge of the police, strapped a forty-five Colt to his manly hip, according to the lurid story written by Mr. Ferrell, and called to his deputies, saying, "Come on, boys, let's clean out Callahan's Dump!"The story was played for a page and a half of type, with pictures. Callahan was such a desperado that his bulldog bit the sheriff, who arrived shooting at the head of his gallant posse. As for Callahan, he was reported to have cursed the heroic sheriff, and surrendered, but not until he had been shot through the hip and disabled for life.</p>
        <p>The posse then killed the bulldog, threw the Callahan woman (discreetly reported by the reporter to be unmarried) into the cold dawn, and wrecked the little three-room shack in which the king outlaw of the plains had led his wicked but modest existence.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="141" />Ferrell had the cops on the run now. Allen was fighting back about liquor, of which he consumed a lusty share himself. The Murdocks, few of whom were lush drinkers, were mostly silent on the prohibition issue. They had a boy in that editorial chair who could blow up such a cloud of smoke as would make prohibition look like a child's argument. It was at this stage of the battle, while carrying the banner and the papers for the Murdocks, that I thought up the Yellow Number. While the town was in a state of orgiastic frenzy about the battle of the newspaper giants, I would do a burlesque on the whole situation, transferring the town to the campus.</p>
        <p>Only two persons were let into the plot at first. Clifton Row, former editor, now running the print shop in the basement, and his assistant, Fred Bond. I asked Cliff to get a supply of yellow stock, sufficient for one number. This he did immediately. I wrote my page one headlines first, and the story to conform. Headlines across page one: "HIDDEN ROOM IN BASEMENT. Shameful Condition Uncovered. Prominent Persons Implicated."Bank lines: "Stranahan's Dump a Disgrace to Friends University. Used to Conceal Crimes, Ponies, and Old Clothes." "Mysterious Disappearance of Textbooks and Innocent Freshmen Accounted for. Toughs Surprised at Card Game."To get a suitable picture for page one I had to let three more persons, then four, into the secret. We rigged up a Y.M.C.A. office as a den of vice. There was a skeleton from the biology lab hung on the wall, a skull on the table at which Ralph Jackson, president of the Y.M.C.A., and Henry Ralstin, president of our class, were caught by the camera while playing cards. The custodian of the building, in police uniform, posed with a pistol in hand, confronting the culprits.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="142" />A pious processor named Stranahan was one of the goats, because Stranahan's Dump sounded like Callahan's. "Jones Runs Amuck! With Sabre and Shotgun He Cleans Out Latin V!" was a headline referring to our most meticulous and reserved faculty member. Pictures of the professors involved in the scandals accompanied the stories.</p>
        <p>All the stories were written by me in the style of Ferrell, now grown familiar to the town.</p>
        <p>Thus:"Yesterday afternoon, as the clock in the University tower was striking 3:40, the Life decided that the hour had struck for a change, Girding a forty-four calibre Waterman upon his hip, the editor called his valiant band of reporters about him, and cried out, "Come on, boys, let's clean up Stranahan's Dump!'" The circumstance that the clock in the tower had never had any works in it, and therefore could not strike, was overlooked by many readers of this report. "The hour has struck for a change!" was one of Ferrell's oft-repeated statements.</p>
        <p>There were stories recounting a knife battle on the front steps between Happy Cosand, a preacher-in-the-making, and Serious Hill, head of the Prohibition League also a trading stamp robbery involving the venerable head of the Bible School, a ticket scandal in which story a facsimile of a counterfeit athletic ticket was shown, and other wild tales of suicide, murder and robbery. There was a police court column with short items relating curious offenses by prominent students and faculty members, and a personal column of the sane kind of stuff.</p>
        <p>Row and his assistant set the type by hand, working day and night. On the night before publication I worked all night with them, until time to carry my Eagle route. I arrived at the college in time for chapel at
        <pb n="143" />ten o'clock, and nervously sat through the exercises.</p>
        <p>Row had the copies for all subscribers arranged in the usual alphabetical manner on a table outside the chapel doors.</p>
        <p>There was no more school that day. Some attempt was made by the stricter professors to carry on, but their pupils paid no attention. They sat and laughed end read passages aloud. Some were shocked, scandalized, and said so to all who would listen.</p>
        <p>The faculty held a meeting in President Stanley's office, doors being shut. A messenger reached me in a corridor. "The President wants to see you." And lo, I appeared in the midst of them!</p>
        <p>I was told to sit in a chair facing my accusers.</p>
        <p>"I presume that you will take responsibility for this?" said President Stanley, his face flushed. Most of the other professors were looking serious, and Stranahan was scarlet up into his bald scalp. Cosand, the kindly English professor, whose favorite pupil I was, looked grave, but patient. The only smiling face was that of Benny Truesdell, one of my best friends on the faculty, who had to hide his face several times as he scanned the monstrous absurdities in the dignified university publication.</p>
        <p>I answered the President that the responsibility was solely mine, that I had planned and executed the thing alone, and that the press was under my orders as editor in printing the sheet at night.</p>
        <p>"What is your purpose in perpetrating such an outrage against your college?" asked the President.</p>
        <p>"The college badly needs a sense of humor," I said.</p>
        <p>"And is this humorous?""Oh, very, Mr. President! Do you hear laughter in the corridors? For the first time since these halls were built, they echo the genuine
        <pb n="144" />laughter of happy students.""You will be held accountable to the faculty and Board. Your case will be taken up at once, and you will be advised of the results. Go to your classes."But there weren't any classes by this time.</p>

        <p>The worst actual tragedy resulting from the Yellow Number was that the mother and sister of Chuck Painter spent two days weeping and explaining to neighbors. They lived in a distant country town and had no telephone. They received University Life as subscribers. When they read that Chuck had dived off the tower of the University building they were desolated. The story said that Chuck, a classmate of mine, was disappointed in love, and chose this spectacular way of ending it all.</p>
        <p>After two days, the sister managed to get a telephone cull through to the secretary to the President, and learned that Chuck was well and would write soon.</p>
        <p>Meantime, the scuttlebutt of the campus was that I was to be expelled for disgracing the Alma Mater. I was informed to this effect about every hour, on the hour. I learned how many friends I had, and who they were. Thirty had signed an agreement to withdraw from school if I were expelled. Others had agreed to attend a protest meeting and sign resolutions which had been drawn up. I was so deeply affected by this show of comradely loyalty by persons whom I respected that I didn't care what the faculty did.</p>
        <p>Two formal meetings of the faculty were held before a vote was taken. It was pointed out by Stranahan that the damage had been done, not on the campus, but among the patrons of the school and among the personnel of the Board of Trustees, who were mostly old-fashioned Quakers, and would consider this evidence that the faculty was letting the school go to hell.</p>
        <p>Benny Truesdell was my advocate. He told the solemn-faced assemblage that the school ought to take me on as publicity director; that the Yellow Number would bring the institution to the attention of many who had never heard of it.</p>
        <p>"But we don't want publicity!" was the answer of the conservatives, and they meant it.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="146" />On the rooming set for the second and decisive meeting of the faculty, the Eagle printed a two-column story about the Yellow Number on its principal news page. The style left no doubt that it was written in whole by Editor Ferrell. It was not only a news account of the hilarious doings at the University, but a wise and humorous editorial commentary as well.</p>
        <p>The Eagle's story was headed: "Mayor Rode Two Automobiles." This referred to a statement in one of my exciting tales that ''The entire city police and detective force visited South Hall this morning. They presented an imposing spectacle, headed by the Mayor in two automobiles, and Commissioner Sam Stewart on an elk, which he is said to have kidnapped from the Zoo. He was dressed in the latest pale yellow libel suit."The reference to Stewart had to do with a libel suit he had just filed against the Eagle. The Eagle story began: "Student editors of the University Life at FriendsUniversity have published an edition this week which is apt to start up their academic clientele very suddenly. Although this edition is conceived in a mirthful spirit the college editors will very likely learn from observing the rabid haste in which their academic readers grab up this issue and rub their eye-glasses for more that a desire for sensations is entirely human.</p>
        <p>"University Life's editors will probably note also that this scare edition will be read from cover to cover. From this experience the editors will note one of the first requisites of the editor's profession, namely that no matter how high-browed may be an editor's intentions and his standards, his dope is of no use unless it has readers. From this little experience in beating the journalistic tom-toms the college editors will note also that the editor can learn much from the patent medicine vendor who takes up his station under a gasoline torch on a street corner."The Eagle story closed with this paragraph:This remarkable tom-tom edition of University Life recalls Herbert Spencer's
        <pb n="147" />comment on a young man who beat him at the game of billiards. The famous philosopher prided himself on his skill with the cue, and was much chagrined when a very young man defeated him. 'Such proficiency, young man,' said Spencer, 'indicates only much idleness and many misspent hours.'"At the faculty meeting that day the temper of the wise men was notably milder than it had been at the previous meeting. Everybody had read the Eagle story, and the humorless ones had begun to see that the laughter was spreading beyond the campus. What would the papers say if the editor who had made them laugh should be expelled for being funny?</p>
        <p>Only three voted for expulsion.</p>
        <p>The verdict was communicated to me by President Stanley, the doors being shut.</p>
        <p>The genial old gentleman relaxed somewhat his stern attitude, laughed pleasantly, and remarked that it seemed the Life had made quite a stir in the community. I still believe that I owed my non-expulsion verdict to Editor Terrell's interest in the case.</p>
        <p>When I called for my papers, next morning, there was a note from CirculationManager Long on my hook. It said that Mr. Ferrell, editor of Mr. Murdock's paper, would like to see me in his office. I did not go. I thought up several reasons for staying away from the editor's office. My clothes were so poor that he would think me a bum. ï¿½Being a Harvard mart, he would immediately sense my almost total ignorance. He might be extremely angry with me for burlesquing his style.</p>
        <p>I went on with my college work, which now included editing of the school's first Annual, called The Talisman, as well as preparing for two state oratorical contests, Old Line and Prohibition. I had represented the college in the state Old Line contest the previous year, and this year had won the local contests in both associations. Participation in either of the state contests paid some part of the student's tuition.</p>
        <p>About two weeks after the Yellow Number incident I received one of those
        <pb n="148" />dreaded special delivery notes at the boarding house. It directed me to see Sidney Long at his desk at the earliest possible hour, that very day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long looked wildly at me from under his heavy white eyebrows, and, in a voice that was choking because he was afraid to yell at me, he said, "Did you get a note, a couple of weeks ago, asking you to see Mr. Ferrell?""Yes sir.""Why didn't you go to see him?"I hesitated, flushed, was at on obvious disadvantage. I mumbled, "I didn't think he really wanted to see me. I'm just a carrier."Mr. Long started to yell, then curbed his voice when he saw that I was rising to leave. He knew that I wouldn't take any more yelling. Hadn't my father been a friend of the elder Mr. Mur-r-r-dock?</p>
        <p>"Nobody ignores an invitation from the editor of this newspaper," said the hysterical circulation manager. "Not even the Mayor, no, nor the Governor. You had better visit Mr. Ferrell right away. He may not repeat his invitation."I spent the next two days in a terrific state of nerves. I was afraid to confront the editor, but more afraid of being fired from my route if I didn't obey orders. On the afternoon of the third day I climbed the stairs to the editorial offices.</p>
        <p>
          <pb n="149" />

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XVII">
        <p>The editor occupied the big corner room, designed for Victor Murdock but seldom used by him, since he had a more extensive one, at public expense, in Washington. The room was on a curving corner of the building, with large windows admitting light and dust, from north and east. The editor had a tremendous roll-top golden oak desk, behind which he could hide from bores.</p>
        <p>He was a little man, with curly hair rapidly departing, twinkling blue eyes with obvious sight defects, silver-rimmed spectacles, florid complexion, a bit of a paunch, and a pipe between his teeth.</p>
        <p>He advanced to the center of the enormous room, stuck out his hand, removed his pipe, grinned broadly, and said, "Wel1, Driscoll, I'm mighty glad to meet you!</p>
        <p>Where in the hell did you get a license to steal my style? You do it better than I do!"Ferrell and I were friends forever after. He was the first real newspaperman I had ever met, and I liked him so well that I hoped, at once, to be a newspaperman, something like him.</p>
        <p>We talked two and a half hours. Ferrell was a prodigious talker, I soon thawed out of my fright, so that I talked too. He asked all about my courses at school, and commented approvingly upon my interest in languages, philosophy andhistory. "To hell with mathematics!" he said. "Did you ever know a math shark who had anything interesting to say?</p>
        <p>"By the way, how would you like to be a reporter here?''I must have turned pale, "Here it comes!" I said to myself. This had been a vague fear in the back of my mind. How was I to explain to this Harvard man how I couldn't possibly be a reporter?</p>
        <p>"Well," I said, "I'd like to be a reporter, after I finish school. But I've got, a good paper route, and it will take me through college. I'm pretty sure that 
        <pb n="150" />I don't know enough to be a reporter.""Horse manure!" said my now friend, smiling broadly. "You can write better than any of those fellows out there now. You know a story when you see one, or I'm a blind mare. You can take on a part-time reporter job right now, and be a full-time reporter when you finish school. I'll keep an eye on you, and so will Burt Doze, the city editor."He asked about my class hours, earnings on the paper route, and other pertinent matters, making notes as he talked.</p>
        <p>Could I operate a typewriter?</p>
        <p>Now I was glad I had those lonely hours before eight o'clock for so many mornings, alone in the business office. During those hours I had experimented with the Oliver typewriters of the stenographers, secretaries and clerks. I had learned to type, not rapidly, but accurately.</p>
        <p>"Doze will arrange your hours to suit your school work," said my hero. "You can go to work tomorrow."I begged for time. I explained that I didn't want to give up try route, as it was sure income. I was not confident that the part-time reportorial job would work out. Would the editor please arrange with Mr. Long to have a substitute take my route while I tried out for the job on the news side? He would, and I need have no worry about that.</p>
        <p>Well, I would have to have time to teach the substitute, to make my back collections, and to arrange some other affairs.</p>
        <p>Could I have two weeks before going to work on the new job?</p>
        <p>"I've known men who were given lese time than that to arrange more complicatedaffairs before going to prison for life," said Ferrell, grinning happily. "But you have it your way."As dinner time came on, Ferrell led me into the city room, and to a long desk,facing another long desk. A chubby-faced blond man in a brownish-gray suit, sitting
        <pb n="151" />in a swivel chair, looked up, smiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doze, this is Charlie Driscoll, the Friends University boy we were talking about. This is our city editor, Charlie, and he'll be your boss. I've just told Charlie that he's to go to work two weeks from today us a reporter, if it's all right with you.""Sure," said Doze, smiling as though some real comedy was about to break. "Sit down, Charlie, if Mr. Ferrell is through with you."There was brief talk, all most friendly. Obviously, Ferrell and Doze had come to an understanding on the matter before I had reported in answer to my second invitation.</p>
        <p>This should be the place to say that I was destined to know Doze well through many years, and that, though I found many reasons for disagreeing with him. I never forgot that, contrary to the custom in such cases, he never held against me the circumstance that I was employed by his superior, over his head, as it were. It is a tradition in newspaperdom that a reporter who is hired by the Big Boss is in for a tough go with the city desk. It was not so in my case.</p>
        <p>I soon had word from Sidney Long that he had a substitute ready to take over my route. Long was almost deferential when he heard that I had been employed by the editorial end. I was to be so much closer to The Family.</p>
        <p>But I was afraid, still, to give up the security of my good route for the insecurity of a part-time reporter's job. I worked out a compromise. I was to stay with the route until Commencement, in the spring. Then I would go to work, full time, at the munificent salary of ten dollars a week. This bargain was sealed all around, and I began at once to serve as University correspondent, sending in items from the campus that were of general interest.</p>
        <p>It was determined, then, that I was not to work on the farm during the summerintervening between my junior and senior years. Mother was overjoyed by the news. "Didn't I tell you," she exclaimed, "that you are to be editor of the Eagle?"
        <pb n="152" />I was embarrassed. I said, "Mother, please don't imagine too much. The editor of the Eagle is a Harvard man, much more learned than I will ever be."My campus items were in the form of memoranda to Burt Doze, since I did not dare to write them out in newspaper form on my own responsibility. I thought that would be presumptuous.</p>
        <p>I worked hard on the Talisman, and, to my pleasant surprise, did not have to do all the work. My associate, Alfrede Horner, an unusually brilliant girl, took over every job that was assigned to her, and did the work well. Design, makeup, cute, general policy find most of the writing were mine. There was a clever poem in original style by red-headed Harry MacPherson, who later became a Hollywood script and song writer.</p>
        <p>The book, 128 pages on sixty-pound enameled paper, with hundreds of pictures, sold for a dollar and a half. Good management and hard work on the part of the three advertising solicitors and a business manager made the book a financial success. Editors did not share in financial profits, but, in a tradition I afterward found deeply rooted in the culture of business offices from coast to coast, worked for experience, glory, and friendly pats on the back.</p>
        <p>That season I went up to Topeka for the state Old Line oratorical contest. I was in bad health, easily explained by overwork, underfeeding, green tomato pies, some nosebleeds, and consequent anaemia [sic]. This was my third appearance as my college's representative in state oratorical contests, and I knew it would be my last. I was determined to get down to school work in earnest next term, starting my senior year.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="A faction in our school, led by Serious Hill, whom I had beaten in the local, contests every time, was becoming allergic to my oratory. Hill introduced a resolution in the oratorical association to bar me from competition, for the strange reason that I won all the contests. The resolution was defeated, but Serious became president of the association, and by dominating a committee, succeeded in having 153" />the customary prize money withheld. It was thirty dollars, and I was counting on it, as I had a right to do. Serious explained that the money was intended originally to cover expenses in employing a coach in public speaking, and that I was so good that I didn't need a coach. Serious also managed, to cut down my Topeka expense account, so that the trip was a financial loss and worry to me.</p>
        <p>I stayed out of the prohibition oratorical contest that winter, because I had too much other work. Serious went to the state content Friends; landed at the bottom.</p>
        <p>But I didn't do much better at Topeka. I didn't miss last place by much.</p>
        <p>It was a gloomy evening. I knew from the start that I couldn't deliver a good job. Voice was about all I had.</p>
        <p>Van came down from Omaha as a surprise auditor. He was a lawyer now, with his own office in the Bee Building, in downtown Omaha. I was flattered by his interest and tried to put on a good show.</p>
        <p>Marie, who accompanied me to Topeka, and I had adjoining rooms at the Jayhawk hotel. When the show was over, she and Van and I went back to my room, where we drank coca-colas. I didn't mind losing, so much as losing before two such loyal family supporters. As for letting my school down, I didn't mind that much. The school, meaning the Serious Hill Oratorical Association, had given me no support, not even paying all of my expenses, and had cheated me out of the agreed prize money. All the other eight contestants were backed up by delegations of yelling students. I had no backers present except these two members of the family.</p>
        <p>We talked things over sadly, as losers do after a prizefight or a horserace. As we were about to retire, Marie said, "I've always heard that you can get consolation
        <pb n="154" />from the Bible, no matter where you open it. Why not try it with this Gideon Bible the hotel has put in the room?"I picked up the unused Gideon, and let it fall open at random.</p>
        <p>The Book opened at pages 190-11, in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, and my eye fall upon the twenty-fourth verse of the ninth chapter: "Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so, run, that, ye may attain.""There is our answer," said the saintly sister.</p>
        <p>"You didn't win this time, but you ran a good race, and you will attain, just as Saint Paul says. The reward of that kind of work doesn't all cone in prizes, nor all in one night. You have worked hard at your public speaking, and have won most of the prizes, maybe a beating is good for you this time." "Yes, it's good for me," I said, "but just think how much joy it will bring to Serious Hill!"I had one more conflict with President Stanley before the end of my junior year. There had been a class scrap, involving lowerclassmen, in the main corridor, just before chapel period. It was short and snappy, but full of action, with dozens rolling on the floor.</p>
        <p>Two unimaginative professors, Wheeler of math and Harvey of biology, waded into the scrap and tried to separate the contestants. They accomplished nothing but gotthemselves badly mussed and their dignities wounded.</p>
        <p>I wrote an editorial, "Who Scrapped?" I castigated the faculty members for their undignified and bootless indulgence in brawl tactics. The language was strong.</p>
        <p>Once more I stood before the mighty Stanley. He was scarlet in the face, boiling over with anger.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Driscoll," he said, "it's getting so that we have an intolerable situation in this institution. You seem to be running the college; I'm just here to spend the money. A member of the faculty can't so much as crook his finger
        <pb n="155" />without exposing himself to your unmitigated castigations!"When he said "crook" he demonstrated by crooking the long finger of his right hand trilling the r. I sat silent, offered to resign as editor, adding that as long as I held the job I would criticize any member of the faculty at my editorial discretion. The Old Man said that if anything like this happened again the newspaper would be suppressed. I knew he was bluffing. He wouldn't dare suppress the newspaper.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="156" />I reported for my first day's work as a newspaper reporter on a Saturday, at noon. Burt Doze sat at his desk, the reporters standing, awaiting their assignments. Doze had an assignment book before him, and copied from the book assignments for each reporter on cards. Each white card, the size of an ordinary filing card, bore the name of a reporter and the day and date.</p>
        <p>Doze told me to remain after the others had gone out on their beats. He talked to me about the work, explained how nearly all reporters had regular rounds to make each day, and were given special assignments besides. He said I would be given the undertakers and hospitals, beginning Monday, and that this was not a difficult beat. I must call on each undertaker, get vital facts on current deaths, and get a story about the dead person when he was important, or when circumstances were interesting. I would have to be curious and ask questions, lest I miss a good story.</p>
        <p>For today, I could sit in the office, help him with copy, go out on the street,or do anything I liked. It would be a good thing to get the hang of things today, and treat the reporters as they came in and went about their work. Maybe he would have a little rewrite for me to do. He handed me a metro and asked me to write a little story from it; just tell the story in my own way.</p>
        <p>I did this quickly, and Doze said it was good. He pointed out that we never used the words yesterday or tomorrow, because items sometimes appeared a day early or a day late, depending upon when the edition went to press. We must therefore say that the funeral would be Tuesday, or that the customer died Monday, or that a meeting would be held on Thursday, and always at 8 a.m., 10 p.m., and never eight o'clock or ten in the evening. I had a fairly good idea of the paper's style, since I had been studying it closely for six months.</p>
        <p>We were never to print items about Negroes except when necessary, and never
        <pb n="157" />to ask for a picture of a Negro, except in case he was a fugitive from justice and wanted by the police. Never bring in a picture of a dead body, nor of a snake. Readers often objected to such things, since they stimulated nightmares. Try to get the essential facts into the lead, which should be brief. But nothing else should be brief. "What this paper needs is copy," said Doze. "I've have a mighty big hole to fill every night, and only a few reporters to fill it. That fat fellow you saw working there when you care in is the only reporter I've got that I can depend on. He is Otho P. Meyers, and he's been here all his life. Middle-aged now. His dad is a gardener south of town."Oh, yes, I knew Old Man Meyers! I had often talked with him in the market. Well, well, so he could have a smart son who was a star reporter! Might be somechance for me some day.</p>
        <p>"Meyers," Doze went on, "writes more than half of the local stuff every day. He's a hard worker, and you'll like him. The other fellows are mostly tramps or kids that will never make it. Ferrell swears you'll make it, and I guess you will." "Here's your first assignment," said the city editor, handing me a card with the single entry, "Real Estate Board."He explained: "This evening this new organization is to have a meeting to talk about getting soft water for Wichita. They'll never do anything but talk. These associations and boards and chambers of commerce never do a damn thing, but they love to talk and get their names printed. Be sure you get all the names. There won't be much else to write about, I guess. George Israel is the big noise in this outfit. He has a real estate office over in the Schweiter building, and the Board has an office there too. You might stroll over before dinner and talk with George. He hasn't sold a square foot of real estate since Chester A. Arthur, but he's a nice guy and likes to talk. Just tell him I sent you."I went right over to talk with Israel. I found him in an enormous suite of offices, alone, smoking a cigar. He was a short, fat, brown-eyed man with an auburn
        <pb n="158" />mustache and thinning hair. His feet didn't reach the floor if he tilted his swivel chair just a little, and he had a habit of talking while resting his neck by holding clasped hands behind his head. He laughed easily, and was the soul of cordiality and helpfulness. He called me Charlie from the first, and reminded me that he had a daughter at Friends University, and that he had learned all about me from her.</p>
        <p>Israel was half Jewish but so unconscious were the people of Wichita of any special difference between Jews and other people that I never heard."Israel's Judaism, mentioned.</p>
        <p>Israel was married to a beautiful red-haired Irish woman, and the daughterwho attended Friends was a typical red Mick, with beautiful white skin. The family attended the Presbyterian church.</p>
        <p>For that matter, there was a Catholic family named Getto, the descendants of old Peter Getto, who came to Wichita when it was an Indian trading post, with a pack on his back. It never occurred to me, despite the obvious surname, that the family might be part Jewish, gradually being absorbed into Kansas Christianity, until I cane to New York, where Getto and Ghetto are prominent names in the garment district.</p>
        <p>Israel talked with me for hours about the water situation. Wichita had about the worst city water supply I've tasted in the Western Hemisphere. It was' pumped by a private monopoly out of beds under the river, and had such a heavy content of salt and gypsum that a two-quart teakettle in daily use would fill up solid with white, hard residue if not cleared of the stuff every day or so. The Santa Fe railroad lost so many locomotive boilers by this caking that it built its own water-works in many spots and used powerful water softeners in the rest of that part of Kansas.</p>
        <p>The water company was a political plum, owned in New York and usually run by a city slicker who saw to it that relations with the city fathers were well oiled.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="159" />If you complained about the water, it was always said that you were giving Wichita a black eye.</p>
        <p>I sat through the meeting that evening, making notes on the talks and cross-examinations. A city commissioner, E. M. Leach, the same who, as salesman forFairmount college, had urged Mother to sell the farm and "come up and live with us,"was on the pan for a shady deal the commission was about to put through to purchase the waterworks at inflated value. The meeting was hot. With all the enthusiasm of a cub reporter, I was convinced that the future of Wichita, if not that of all human society, depended upon action along lines laid down by friends of the Real Estate Board.</p>
        <p>I returned to the office about ten o'clock and wrote two thousand words onthe meeting.</p>
        <p>To my amazement and pride, the Sunday morning paper carried the whole story,exactly as written, under a two-column news head: '"Call halt on Hasty Action to Purchase Water Works." It was a policy story, written exactly in accord with the paper's political course.</p>
        <p>Of course I waited for the first copies to come up from the pressroom, took two, and rode my bicycle out to the farm at top speed, to show my very first journalistic triumph to Mother. After reading the text carefully, two or three times, Mother said, wiping her glasses, "John must read this. "It pays to send a boy to school."I continued to live at Aunt Lida's. There were boarders from Summer School at the campus, not so many as in winter, and all complete strangers. They were mostly schoolteachers from the rural areas, trying to earn credits.</p>
        <p>My visits to the farm became less frequent and more depressing. Mother's health was declining rapidly. John had become too lazy to chop wood necessary to keep the kitchen fire going. Mother spent much of her tine gathering chips, or kippens, as she called them, from around the chopping block, where they had been
        <pb n="160" />accumulating for years. She had bean to a doctor who told her she had high blood pressure. She dozed easily in midday.</p>
        <p>There were hot winds that summer, and crops burned up. Walking the scorching pavements, almost deserted by traffic, was warm work, but I was so deeply immersed in learning about my job that I scarcely noticed the discomforts.</p>
        <p>I soon became friendly with everybody in the undertaking business. They were, without exception, hungry for publicity, hateful of competitors, and unmindful of ethics in their cutthroat methods of competition. Nearly all of them took me more or less deeply into their confidences, since they knew that I was catching on anyway during my hours of loafing about the funeral parlors. There were no morticians at that time, and the first funeral home had not been opened. They still occupied ordinary store rooms, with coffins or potted plants in the windows. A favorite display piece was a baby's casket, backed by a rubber plant.</p>
        <p>The coroner, also, was a friend who needed publicity and worked closely with me because I could give him a lot of it. He was Matt M. McCollister, an amusing old slob, almost toothless, unspeakably dirty, ignorant of the simplest English syntax, always chewing tobacco, standing with his back against a building for support; a veritable Jeeter Lester.</p>
        <p>One day there was a call for me from McCollister. Man killed in basement of Schweiter building (this was the town's skyscraper, ten stories high, at the chief street intersection, Main street and Douglas avenue, two blocks from the Eagle plant.) It was a hot July day.</p>
        <p>The deceased, as he was usually called in our stories, was a janitor in the building. He was taking ashes from the furnace or boiler room in the basement to the alley level on an elevator designed for such work. The elevator had no sides, but a heavy metal floor, on which the ashes were piled.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the man had started the elevator by pressing a button on a pillar near it, as was customary, and after the thing had started upward, had decided to
        <pb n="161" />jump aboard. He apparently slipped and fell, feet first, almost clearing all danger. Just his head was caught between the side of the moving steel platform and the heavy concrete first floor member.</p>
        <p>McCollister had just arrived, in a filthy old shirt and pants, when I walked in. He carried a small fire shovel and a collapsible paper cake box, begged from a bakery on the other side of the street.</p>
        <p>"Got to scoop up some of these brains," he said, starting to work with great gusto. The brains were splattered over at least a hundred square feet of bare concrete floor, ceiling, walls and columns.</p>
        <p>"Why don't you let the undertaker and the police attend to that?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Oh, I never shirk my duty," he said, grinning appreciatively as he worked. "Besides, I want some of 'em to show the boys up to the Courthouse. They won't believe me if I ain't got the brains to show 'em. Jesus, I never thought a janitor would have so many brains!"I got the essential facts from the manager of the building, got the victim's home address, and learned that ho had no telephone. I went to the home, informed the widow and children, and took a photograph off a dresser while the family was having hysterics. I wrote a good story, and felt that I was getting on in the world. When I had finished my story I took a walk along East Douglas avenue. There, leaning up against the exterior of an undertaking shop was Matt the Coroner, stopping all who would listen, telling the story of the unfortunate janitor, and opening up his cake box. "I got his brains here," he was saying, "the poor son of a bitch. Nice lot of brains, ain't it?" Most of the customers hurried on.</p>
        <p>Matt McCollister had been a neighbor of ours. He had squatted on an island in the middle of the Arkansas river, where there was neither rent nor taxes to pay. But there was hell to pay when the floods came. So Matt sold the squatter's rights to Old Man Kongle, moved to town, and ran for county coroner. This job required no
        <pb n="162" />qualifications, such as are required in most states. The reward was small, few wanted the job, and election cost nothing. It was just one of those offices at the bottom of the list which few voters took the trouble to check.</p>
        <p>Since I had launched the drive of public opinion against the political raw deal involving city purchase of the outworn waterworks, I was assigned the follow-up stories. There were further meetings of the realty men, then a public mass meeting, and, finally, a political campaign to recall the mayor and certain commissioners.</p>
        <p>The recall campaign was one of the hottest political campaigns ever seen by Wichitans, with the Eagle backing recall and the Beacon violently defending Commissioner Leach and the wishy-washy Mayor John H. Graham.</p>
        <p>Leach had a genius for making a fool of himself in a public speech. He spoke extemporaneously, and never failed to trip himself up with silly statements and admissions of ineptitude. I followed him about town, reported his speeches correctly, but with emphasis upon the absurdities, and so made him furious. He turned from his audience to address me, shaking his finger at me and denouncing the paper I represented in angry and unrestrained tones. Every newspaper man knows that when you get them acting that way you have your battle almost won.</p>
        <p>The Eagle won its recall fight, the objectionable politicians were ousted and our side was back in City Hall. I was kept on the water story and the realty men. A large supply of good water was discovered at Mission Springs, 25 miles from Wichita. The realtors, with backing of the Eagle, started a fight for a supply of good water that lasted about thirty years, and finally was won, but not without expensive compromise with the politically powerful water company.</p>
        <p>The circulation department gently reminded me of the rule that a carrier may not leave his route to a substitute core than one month. That time had elapsed, and some weeks besides. Sorry, but I'd have to make up my mind between editorial and circulation.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="163" />I applied for reinstatement as a carrier, a simple procedure, since it was my bond that still guaranteed payment of weekly bills, and I knew the route so well that I needed only a summary of stops and starts since the substitute had taken over.</p>
        <p>I said nothing to the city editor about taking back the route. But I was sure that my reportorial job would cease when I went back to school in the fall, and I was confident that I could handle both jobs during the summer.</p>
        <p>Reporters were supposed to report for assignments at noon, but it was often one o'clock before the city desk had assignments ready. Meantime the reporters sat about reading, smoking, or, in the case of Star Reporter Otho P. Meyers, writing copy left over from yesterday's unused notes. Meyers was a bachelor, and liked the atmosphere of the city room much better than that of his furnished room home. I arranged my new hours thus. I would be a little late for noon assignment time, and yet in plenty of time for actual handing out of assignments. Thus I would save a half hour. Reporters usually finished writing up their day's material by midnight or one o'clock. The late watch, running up to press time on the Home edition, about three o'clock, was rotated among the staff, new and young reporter usually taking it about twice as often as the older men.</p>
        <p>As a matter of practice, most of the staff stayed on until the papers came up from the pressroom, and the Home was really put to bed. No graveyard watch was maintained, to cover possibly important news between three o'clock and the beginning of the business day.</p>
        <p>I usually stayed until the Home was on the press. Now that I had taken my route back, I always stayed for press time, registered first of all the carriers, got my paper sack from its hiding place in a corridor lumber room, and delivered my papers long before dawn. Then I rode my bicycle out to 1616 University avenue and went to bed.</p>
        <p>Foregoing breakfast, I usually managed to get about five hours of sleep, or
        <pb n="164" />at least of rest in bed. I tried to make my collections and solicitations on Sundays and Mondays, but I found that Sunday collecting was unprofitable. On that day I went to an early class as soon as I had disposed of my paper bag, as the canvas double pocket for carrying the papers was called. I was dirty and in working clothes, but the hour was early, and many Sunday workers were present. By the time Mass was finished, it was late. In order to cover the route for collections, I would have to go without sleep and work all afternoon. So many people were not at home, and so many others frowned upon Sunday activity, that I gave up this time-saver and depended upon Monday for collecting. As always, I fell behind in this important work, but always paid my bills promptly at the circulation desk.</p>
        <p>If the roads were passable, I rode my bicycle out to the farm, talked, ate the hearty meals Mother prepared for me, wandered about the decaying farm, and slept irregularly. I usually tried to get a little sleep Sunday night, leaving a request for the telephone company to ring at a certain hour, so that I might be at work early.</p>
        <p>The wake-up service was a part of the courtesy dividend the telephone companies in those parts rendered in those days. I often left a call for three a.m. when the next morning was a delivery morning for me. Once the operator neglected the call, and it was dawn when I awoke, heart pounding, frightened almost out of my wits. I raced to town without breakfast, to find that I was the last carrier out. Apparently there were no complaints. I had no reprimand from Sidney.</p>
        <p>But to this day I awake from a nightmare, screaming. I have overslept, and my route is undelivered!</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XX">
        <p>I postponed entering school that fall of 1911, when my senior year began, so that I might save money, perhaps enough to carry me through the year. I thought I would be able to catch up with my class easily enough if I were only a month behind, and that month meant a nice sum in the savings. There would be no editing of college paper or annual this "year, and, I hoped, no oratorical contents. I hated to give up the reportorial job.</p>
        <p>I resigned the job when I saw how far ahead my classmates were getting, after a month.</p>
        <p>"We don't like to lose you," said City Editor Doze, "but we don't want to interfere with your education. How about part-time work here? Maybe you can fit it into your school program.</p>
        <p>I explained that my school hours would be 8:40 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Doze said, "Come to work after your last clasp and leave at midnight, if that isn't too tough for you. You can turn in more copy in that time than most of them in a full day."When I asked how much of a cut I'd have to take, Doze was embarrassed. "You'll continue on your present pay. It should be more, but we cut the hours and call it a raise."I was happy. Ten dollars a week all winter! No need to worry about finances now. And I loved the work.</p>
        <p>Now began the most back-breaking, cruelly punishing work period of my life. I felt sure that I couldn't swing the reportorial job along with my school work, so I held on to the paper route as long as my body and mind would stand the triple job program: student, reporter, carrier. I slept on a table in the dusty file room, got on my route with the first carriers, and sometimes got an hour or two of sleep at the boarding house.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="166" />I lost weight, went into a profound anemia, with nosebleeds, and could not concentrate on my books.</p>
        <p>Scarcely able to walk, I notified Sidney Long that I was ready to give up my route. Thedie [sic] was cast. I was a newspaperman now, and for always. I had worked hard for those extra credits in school law and theory of education. They would be no good to me now. I would never teach in a high school, if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Long asked me to pick a successor to my route, and in a sleepy moment I said yes to the wrong boy. A shifty-eyed fellow whom I did not know, from one of the lower classes, asked me for the route. I said yes, on one condition. I was away behind in my collections. Here were my receipt pads. I would charge him nothing for transfer of the route, but would require him to collect these back dimes for me, sixty dollars in all. He said he would do that, on his honor. (Where have I heard that expression since, with the same connotation?) Having no honor, the young man collected the moneyï¿½and kept it. The day I quit the route, Ferrell called me into his office.</p>
        <p>"I hear you've been gettin' away with something, boy!" he said, with a wide grin. "A reporter and carrier too! Didn't you know that's a crime here? You can't hold a job in editorial and business both. Wait till Marcellus hears about this."Ferrell wanted to know how I had stood up under the strain of the two jobs and school work. Looking me over critically, he said, "You can kill yourself that way, Charlie. Please don't try anything like that again, ever."Well, the experience did one thing for me. It made me think that everybody has been handing me easy assignments ever since.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="167" />The phenomenon of the student holding two jobs in different departments, without knowledge of the executives, became a standing joke in the plant. I was greeted with grins, loud laughter, and smart remarks everywhere. Doze asked why Long hadn't fired me, and Long merely looked into his wastebasket and showed his back teeth. He was calling me Mister now.</p>
        <p>In school, I worked at making up back lessons and lectures. I had every possible consideration and help from the faculty members, and from classmates. By Thanksgiving I was doing well in all my classes. That was a great satisfaction, for I had fallen down in marks during my junior year.</p>
        <p>I picked up some news story for the Eagle every day on the campus. The college was no longer publicity-shy. It appreciated the favorable attitude the town was beginning to show toward it.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I tossed an exclusive news bombshell, lead position, page one, with art and scare-head and five-line bank.</p>
        <p>Ralph Jackson, of Pond Creek, Oklahoma, who had graduated the previous spring, was now Professor Jackson, teaching mathematics in the high school at Sterling, Kansas. On October 12, 1911, I informed the world that Professor Jackson had disappeared in Wichita on the previous Saturday morning at half-past three in the morning, and had not been seen since by friends or relatives, who were numerous.</p>
        <p>Jackson was a quiet, serious, religious, good-humored fellow of twenty-seven years, had been a model student, and president of the Friends Y.M.C.A.</p>
        <p>He came from an Oklahoma farm, was as poor as most of us, and was not a social success. He was conscious of his poor clothes and farm manners, as which of us was not?</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="168" />Ralph had left Sterling, a short railroad ride from Wichita, on a Friday evening, saying he was going to visit his mother and some friends in Wichita. An old college friend rode with him as far as Wichita, where the two separated cordially. That was all.</p>
        <p>The high school was inquiring, and Ralph's parents were wild. Police turned up no clues, but sent out a missing persons alarm.</p>
        <p>After my first story I had the case permanently. I had many exclusive angles, on account of my long association with the young man and his friends. I called at police headquarters, in the same block with the newspaper, every night before writing the story.</p>
        <p>A detective who was working on the case said, "Boy, you're young. What's the use beatin' your brains out? Just another man-and-woman case."I was really indignant. I gave the veteran dick some of my best senior collegiate English and wisdom.</p>
        <p>"You know a lot of criminals, but you don't know very much about high-grade people like Jackson," I said. "Maybe I know something about this case that you don't know. I know the young man well. I'm willing to tell you all I know, and you just sit there and grin and chew tobacco. If you're as smart as you think you are, why don't you solve every crime? Most mysteries are never solved by the police."I was overreaching myself a little, due to inexperience, but for the final statement of that paragraph I've never had to apologize. Many years of reporting, much of it in connection with crime, verifies the rash conclusion I then made. Even the solutions for which the police get credit are generally attributable to newsmen or stool pigeons. 
        <pb n="169" />So the detectives, impressed by my obvious sincerity, and sorry for my ignorance of the world, gathered around, and I related all I knew about Ralph Jackson.</p>
        <p>"He is a calm, quiet, plodding young man, neither brilliant nor dumb," I said. "He certainly isn't crazy. He is religious in a quiet Quaker manner, but not fanatical about it. He studied hard in school, but graduated without any signs of physical or mental scars from hard study and a rather a meager life. He could not be induced to do a dishonest or dishonorable thing."The detectives smoked or chewed, spitting on the floor, lolling in their creaky old chairs, with deadpan faces. They did not interrupt, nor did anyone take notes. I was annoyed by the absence of alertness, of any sign of interest in the case which concerned me so closely.</p>
        <p>"What about women?" asked Number One detective.</p>
        <p>"Ralph never paid any attention to any of the girls at Friends," I replied. "We all knew he was engaged to marry a Quaker girl of his home town as soon as he could afford marraige [sic], probably this year.""So he goes up to Sterling, meets another broad, and disappears. A lot of 'em do that.""If you'd take the trouble to go to Sterling, you'd find that Ralph had no girl friend there.""All right; some place else. But you kids are wasting time and money, looking for this angel in the rivers and woods."
        <pb n="170" />I talked to a mass meeting of collegians. We raised money for the search, ordered a poster offering &amp; reward for information. School was closed for a day, while students and faculty, under direction of a private detective agency, beat the bush for clues.</p>
        <p>As soon as the private agency came in, the cops withdrew from the case officially. Cynical grins and fatherly advice greeted me, at headquarters, but no information was forthcoming. I included some implied criticism of the police in my stories of the lack ofprogress in the case.</p>
        <p>Students solicited contributions from Quakers of the neighborhood, and the response was good. We dragged the river, explored the larger sewers, and searched the woods for miles. No clues.</p>
        <p>The mystery, whipped up by our paper's daily coverage, became a town sensation. Crazy people, fortune tellers and mystics, who always offer advice or solutions in such cases, wrote hundreds of letters. The police wouldn't even read them.</p>
        <p>Ralph was at the bottom of a river, in a certain spot, scenery carefully described, according to one crystal-gazer. But diving and dragging missed him.</p>
        <p>Search of Jackson's room in Sterling revealed no clues. Letters from home, from the girl friend in Oklahoma, revealed nothing pertinent.</p>
        <p>Cards bearing Jackson's picture and the offer of regard were distributed at entrances to all shows and churches. It was thought that in this way someone might be found who had seen Jackson after he left the early train in Wichita. No results.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="171" />We settled upon a theory that Jackson had started to walk the three or four miles to the men's dormitory at Friends, because no trolleys were running, and had been waylaid, killed, and that the body had been disposed of in some one of many possible ways.</p>
        <p>There was a rise in the Arkansas river, due to heavy rains. Students and friends organized a patrol of the river banks, to watch for the body, which experts said night be washed up on the bank in such a time.</p>
        <p>A theory advocated by some of the mystery-solvers was that Jackson had broken-down nervously or mentally, and might have wandered off after leaving the train. He had complained of being ill during the week before his leaving Sterling for the visit. Symptoms, he thought, might indicate typhoid. Could he have developed a high fever and become lost while irrational?</p>
        <p>He had spent the summer in graduate work at the University of Chicago, though he could ill afford the expense. His people were poor, and had spent every cent they could find upon Ralph's education. The money he had in his pocket was at least part of his first earnings resulting from his education. He had just been paid for his first month's teaching.</p>
        <p>All these theories, and many more, were threshed out in the stories I wrote daily for the Eagle.</p>
        <p>After a month, cost of the Jackson friends gave up the search. Every clue had been exhausted. There was talk of raising funds for a memorial scholarship, to be used in perpetuity by worthy but poot [sic] young men of Oklahoma, before whom the brief but creditable career of Ralph Jackson would be held as a spur to Christian learning and upright living.</p>
        <p>The elder Jacksons moved from Oklahoma to a Quaker settlement at Friendswood, Texas. They never gave up hope that Ralph was alive.</p>
        <p>The break came five months after the disappearance. The elder
        <pb n="172" />Jacksons received an ananymous [sic] letter postmarked Tampico, Mexico. It said that Ralph would receive mail at such-and-such an address. The elder Jackson immediately set out for Mexico, hunted high and low, and, with guides furnished by the American consul, found his son.</p>
        <p>Ralph was a manual laborer in oil fields, forty-five miles inland from Tampico. He had found as nearly an inaccessible spot as possible, and had settled there, alone.</p>
        <p>I wired and telephoned to likely points in Oklahoma, Texas and Mexico, and finally received a collect telegram of six full pages from Ralph's father, explaining opinions and beliefs in utmost detail, and closing with the seemingly needless expensive words, "All things work together for good to them that love God. God bless you all. Send a copy." This came from Tampico.</p>
        <p>The story, in brief, was that Ralph had suffered a nervous breakdown, thought he was not making good in his teaching job, and ran away from it all to escape disgrace of failure.</p>
        <p>It was a severe let-down for the faithful. As for Chief of Police George Cubbon, who had backed up his detective force most vehemently he greeted my news with a knowing smile. "Well, Charlie," he said, "you're growing up in this wicked world, and it's tough for you. Didn't we tell you it was woman trouble?"During the following June, nine months after the disappearance, Ralph came to Wichita to attend a Friends meeting of some sort. I reached him by phone, but he refused to talk, beyond a friendly but solemn greeting.</p>
        <p>A few days later he and the girl were married. They had grown up together in Oklahoma. Ralph went to work as a farm hand for the girl's father.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="173" />I had learned something about news mysteries, at the cost of rather violent spiritual discomfort.</p>

        <p>Interesting adult characters were beginning to come within my limited horizon.</p>
        <p>Many of them had been mythical figures to me, as important persons, "who, soon as we are born are straight our friends." Many of our heroes and gods in this frontier country were of flesh and blood. They were respected, honored and celebrated in print because they represented something which we isolated prisoners of drought and boredom recognized as ideals we would love to emulate.</p>
        <p>Buffalo Bill Cody had not yet been invented by his supreme press-agent, so far as we Kansans were concerned, until about the time I entered preparatory school. When his Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the world visited Wichita, Cody met "The Real Buffalo Bill." Because Wichita papers were cold toward Buffalo Bill Cody, who, they claimed, had stolen and exploited the title of our own Billy Matthewson, the publicity department of the Wild West show made arrangements for the two pioneers to meet and shake hands before the camera.</p>
        <p>Cody was a natural showman, and appeared in full Wild West regalia Matthewson, a whiskered, graying farmer, who had killed, according to local legend, sore buffalo than Bill Cody ever saw, appeared for the interview in his modest Sunday clothes.</p>
        <p>The picture merely brought out the dash and glory of the handsome Cody, and made the stooped Uncle Billy Matthewson look worn and ordinary. Billy Matthewson had been a real frontier plainsman in the days before white settlement of Kansas had begun. He had slaughtered the buffalo on a large scale, to fill contracts for the army and other agencies. Of course, he had fought Indians as a matter of routine. When the buffalo were cleared away, Matthewson staked out a claim which now had become a part of the City of Wichita. Thirty acres of the farm remained in the original sod condition, surrounded by suburban streets and homes. This plot, known as Matthewson's Pasture, was the field where all the circuses showed. Revenue
        <pb n="175" />from the circuses paid the taxes, and Uncle Billy wanted no more from the tract. It remained untouched by plow, spade or builder, except as it was disturbed by the showmen, until after Uncle Billy's death, many years later.</p>
        <p>Matthewson owned a large farm near ours, but closer to town, on the north side of the Arkansas river. Virgin forest, with some of the oldest cottonwood and elm trees in Kansas as interesting features, bordered the river to a depth of about a half mile. A field of a hundred acres or more was planted to corn for many years. The Matthewson farming was marked by straight rows, a good stand of corn, and the cleanest cultivation of any field for miles about.</p>
        <p>When alfalfa became a fairly sound crop investment, Uncle Billy had his large field planted entirely to it. His methods of handling the comparatively new crop were the most advanced. As he had been a thorough cowboy and hunter in his youth, so he was an expert farmer in his later years. He and my Dad often stopped along the road for talk of crops and doings of the world. As a child, I stood in awe of the pioneers for I heard many true tales of their adventures and hardships. They were men who commanded respect.</p>
        <p>Farmer Doolittle was unique. Never, I am sure, has God experimented with another specimen so quaint, so oddly formed, physically and mentally.</p>
        <p>I first met Farmer personally when I went to work as a reporter. He was a reporter too. He had been associated with the paper, first as correspondent and then as reporter, since the founding of the struggling sheet by Old Marsh Murdock, in 1872.</p>
        <p>Yes, there was, and, I suppose, is, such a stream as Cowskin Creek, commonly called The Cowskin. Farmer Doolittle (whose real name only a few people ever heard, and none remembered) was a pioneer settler along the creek, probably twenty miles from the village of Wichita. He was a bachelor, and always remained so. As soon as the Eagle began publication he subscribed for it. He paid for his subscription by writing amusing reports of conditions and news along the Cowskin. As he had no
        <pb n="176" />neighbors to speak of, he reported on the badgers, fish, coyotes, and Indians, who were always referred to in the paper as Redskins or Red Devils. In the early files of the paper I found many local news items about arrival, by horseback, of farmers and hunters who had reported shooting so-and-so many Red Devils on the way. It was sport, something like shooting coyotes.</p>
        <p>Farmer Doolittle was not quite illiterate. He wrote out his items in the quaint and unschooled lingo of the early plainsman, and the customers liked it.</p>
        <p>When The Farmer came to town on one of his rare trading trips, he visited his editor, Marsh Murdock, as a matter of course. He was given a stack of copy paper and some pencils for his future correspondence, and was greatly impressed by the supposed erudition of the old man, whose chief claim to historical fame was that he had been a resident of Lawrence, Kansas, during the border warfare that preceded the hanging of John Brown, before the War Between the States. When Quantrell and his guerillas came over from Missouri and sacked Lawrence, Murdock, so went the legend, had saved his life by hiding in a privy vault in a back street.</p>
        <p>After some years of unpaid corresponding, Farmer Doolittle was weathered outof his farming enterprise. He went to Wichita, and became the first paid reporter, devoting his time exclusively to reporting news for the Eagle.</p>
        <p>When I was a small boy the rawboned reporter often was pointed out to me as one of the sights of the town. He was nearly seven feet tall, bony, thin, lanky, stooped, awkward, ungainly, with a disproportionately long head, wrinkled face, a beak like that of the turkey buzzard, and a bony jaw that was perpetually wagging in the process of chewing enormous quids of tobacco.</p>
        <p>Farmer spoke in a cracked soprano voice which did not carry well. A possible cause for the marked stoop which developed early in life was the necessity for getting down on a level with anybody with whom he wished to speak.</p>
        <p>He wore one of the broad-brimmed, high-crowned Stetson hats that were sensible and practical equipment for workers under the cruel Kansas sun, at least three
        <pb n="177" />generations before those hats became an affectation of dude ranch customers and drug store cowboys of the screen and radio. I have reason to believe that Farmer wore the same Stetson from young manhood until his passing at a great age.</p>
        <p>Since it was obviously impossible for Farmer to fit himself into any ready-madeclothes, he made his own. The tailoring was amateurish, even after many years of experience. His costuming was grotesque beyond imagination. He originated his own styles and modes, used almost any kind of material that came to hand, and sewed witha needle that might have served as a wicked weapon in a fight. If heavy linen thread was available, it was used. If not, white grocery string or manilla wrapping twine would do.</p>
        <p>Inhabitants of the town always regarded Farmer as a rather amusing freak, a joke, or a friendly clown who might do you a favor by getting your name into print if you agreed with him in some of his preposterous theories.</p>
        <p>Because of the high soprano voice, a certain old-womanish facial contour, and the perpetual bachelorhood unadorned by any Don Juan legends, it was common belief in the Valley that Farmer was a hermaphrodite, always pronounced morphodite by Kansans. I often heard the story of a certain business man, who, carried away by his naive curiosity, asked The Farmer point-blank, whether this common belief ware based upon physiological fact. Farmer replied, "Ask your wife; she ought to know."During my days on the Eagle, Farmer was an ancient, having celebrated the fortieth anniversary of his service, or servitude, with the Murdocks. His grotesque frame seemed to have doubled twice in spinal folds, bringing the strangely unhuman head down almost to the level of an ordinary man's head, he had been covering the livestock market at the stockyards for many years, and still was making some motions in that direction. He came into the office almost every day with gossip heard at the stockyards. As for market reports, they were handled in routine fashion by other hands.</p>
        <p>Farmer was a pious Baptist. When he heard me cursing a rickety typewriter
        <pb n="178" />while pounding it with my fists in a vain attempt to get action out of it, he stalked across the city room from the little alcove in which he made or dictated the notes from which his signed stories were written, and ordered me to stop the vile language. I was too much absorbed in the job of getting black marks on copy paper to reply.</p>
        <p>Presently I was cursing the worthless machine again, in wild exasperation. It was an ancient Smith-Premier, with two keyboards, one for caps and the other for lower case, and it had long passed its years of usefulness. Farmer had never learned to use a typewriter, and therefore did not appreciate the aggravation that impelled me to the use of profanity.</p>
        <p>Farmer approached me again, addressed himself first to me, then to Doze: "I ain't a-goin' to stay in the same room with a young feller that swears an' curses!" he declared. "I'm goin' right down an' tell Mr. Murdock!"I had a personal and good-humored request from Garland Ferrell the next day. "The old fellow is God-damned peculiar, you know, Charlie, and we all baby him.</p>
        <p>He's not quite all there, and never was, if I know anything about him. But he's a tradition and an inexpensive one. You have mortally offended him by using profane language in the city room. I suggest that you write a note to Marcellus, expressing profound regret for your so great offense. Then the old fellow will love you, and we'll be spared the embarrassment of an altogether unnecessary feud between the younger and older generations."I happily wrote the note, something like this:"Dear Marcellus: I'm sorry I offended Farmer by talking to my so-called typewriter from my heart, and I hope you will assure him that none of my prayers, adjurations or imprecations was addressed to him.</p>
        <p>"It seems that I suggested certain indignities that should be performed upon this worthless machine, but I had no particular operator in mind in calling out for volunteers to assist me in thus expressing, in obscene and primitive mode, the
        <pb n="179" />contumely which so contemptible an instrument deserves at the hands of a an outraged society.</p>
        <p>"While my intentions are good, Mr. Murdock, the irritation of temper incident to the operation of this piece of junk are such that I judge it to be expedient that you supply se with a new and workable typewriter forthwith, to insure against further annoyance to our respected colleague, The Farmer."I got the new typewriter, and was overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Farmer always was treated deferentially by Ferrell, Doze, and other staff men. His clothing was filthy, and in a sad state of disrepair, and there was a certain aroma about his person which was compounded only partly of tobacco. He now wore steel-rimmed spectacles, which he had bought from a pitchman for a quarter. He realized that he had been cheated in being charged such an inflationary price for such obfuscated lenses, but he wore then and resignedly accepted as real the distorted world they presented to his vision.</p>
        <p>Farmer lived in a furnished room in a cheap rooming house. As he drew on toward the inevitable end, the traditional generosity of The Family was expressed in assurances that the old fellow might work or not work, as seemed good to him at any time, but that, as long as he lived he would be continued on on the payroll at a special salary of twenty-five dollars a week. This spectacular promotion was not destined to be for long a burden upon the receipts of the prosperous newspaper. Farmer managed to climb the stairs to the city room until within two weeks of the end. The Family provided, at great expense, a made-to-order coffin to contain the extraordinary frame; and buried The Farmer on a green hill overlooking the scene of his protracted labors.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="__________" />
        <pb n="180" />A traditional character of our small newspaper world was Dave Leahy, formally David D. Leahy. He was already old when I went to work for the Eagle, and was enjoying an interlude of employment on the Beacon. He worked for either paper without prejudice, and accepted only a small increase in salary when he transferred from one to the other.</p>
        <p>There had been times, in Dave's zenith of reportorial glory, when he consented to work for both papers at the same time. When Sockless Jerry Simpson debated political issues and economic problems with Lawyer Chester I. Long, during the Populist-Republican campaign of 1896, Dave was the Eagle's star reporter, and the only one capable of reporting such a great event. The Beacon had nobody who could handle the job. So Dave consented to write the story for the Beacon after he had done his duty for the opposition.</p>
        <p>Feeling was running high, with the farmers carrying pitchforks in their torchlight parades. The pitchforks were supposed to be a tribute to a great Free Silver hero, Pitchfork Jim Tillman, of Tennessee. But the farmers feared they might be attacked by the bloated capitalists and followers of Mark Hanna, so they never left their pitchforks at home when there were rallies or political meetings. The Eagle was for McKinley and Hobart, and for Chester I. Long, a stuffed shirt corporation lawyer, while the Beacon was fighting loudly for Sockless Jerry and Bryan.</p>
        <p>The debate filled the old wooden Auditorium to capacity, and I, a farm kid in bare feet, was lucky to get a seat astride one of the two-by-six rafters.</p>
        <p>Dave Leahy, most important man-with-pencil, went to the Eagle city room after the show and wrote three columns, with the banner head, "LONG FLAYS SIMPSON!" The text told how the sockless wonder had been taken for an awful drubbing, had disgraced himself by his ignorance, and how Long had
        <pb n="181" />triumphed by sheer logic.</p>
        <p>Having delivered his copy, Dave went over to the Beacon and wrote the same story, reversed. It appeared under a head proclaiming that Our Jerry had humiliated Mark Hanna's Long, ridiculed the fat little lawyer, and glorified the lean, active Man of the Soil from Medicine Lodge.</p>
        <p>It was known to most readers that the two accounts were written by the same reporter. "What a man that Dave Leahy is!" said the customers.</p>
        <p>Dave attended the Pro-Cathedral, spoke with a slight but attractive Irish brogue, was reputed to be learned in Irish lore and Catholic doctrine, and was a great attraction to all the girls of the parish in his early days, my older sisters said he was unquestionably the handsomest young man in the congregation. He wore flashy clothes, a fancy vest, smoked a pipe gracefully, drank plenty of free liquor about town, and talked, free of charge, at all Irish and Catholic gatherings. He was six feet and three inches high and wore a large red mustache, also carried a cane in approved fashion for a young rake.</p>
        <p>In his latter years Dave became sloppy in his dress, seldom got a haircut or shave, but retained a powerful sense of humor and a fatherly attitude toward all promising young reporters. I have a stack of kindly letters that he wrote me after I left the home town, and they contain sage wisdom which I should have studied more thoughtfully than I did.</p>
        <p>__________I was given fires, in addition to my undertakers, hospitals and charitable institutions, and enjoyed the added responsibility. The fire department was extraordinarily well conducted. Motorized equipment was coming in faster than in most
        <pb n="182" />cities that were three or four times the size of Wichita. One of the old horse-drawn pumping engines, operated by steam, was fitted with a motor pulling unit, though the steam engine remained intact, with its picturesque copper vertical boiler, shaped like an inverted pear, and its steel-tired wooden wheels, brightly painted. A hose wagon, entirely self-propelled, was added to headquarters equipment.</p>
        <p>Headquarters was next door to City Hall, adjoining the Eagle building on the west. As I sat in the city room during the afternoons, I could hear alarms ring in, and a list on the wall told me the approximate location of the fire. A direct line to the station was on the city desk. I called and was told the exact location of the fire. If it looked interesting, I ran downstairs and stood at the curb. As the first truck or engine rolled by, not yet up to its best speed, I swung aboard, standing on the running-board beside the brave boys with red suspenders, feeling quite in the thick of things.</p>
        <p>One of my best fires, from a news story standpoint, was a small one, easily taken care of by a fireman with a hand extinguisher. An old brick building, formerly housing the Mentholatum factory, on East Douglas avenue, had become a tenement house, occupied by poor families that did not insist upon repairs, redecoration or modern fixtures. We ran up two flights of wooden stairs and found the furnishings of a large room afire.</p>
        <p>When the fire was out, trouble had just begun. A fireman took from the smoldering bed beside the center table a baby, only a year old. I called police, asking for a doctor. Response was prompt. While the firemen were clearing the room of smoke, the doctor was undressing the child and examining it.</p>
        <p>Just then a hysterical old lady burst into the room, tossing an armful of grocery packages on the floor and screaming, "Where is the baby? Oh, Spirit World! Oh, Spirit World! Give back the baby, and I'll convert all my friends!"She was the grandmother. Her daughter, mother of the baby, had gone to thenickelodeon to spend the evening, leaving the baby in charge of Grandma. The old
        <pb n="183" />lady became hungry, and went to a neighborhood store to get something to eat. She left the baby asleep. It had wakened, stood up, and pulled the kerosene lamp over the side of the table, upon itself. It was crying feebly, flesh scorched, rapidly dissolving its frail ties with its sordid environment.</p>
        <p>The baby died before we left the tenement, while the mother was still enjoying the "Perils of Pauline."It chanced that this derelict household was directly and closely related to Sockless Jerry Simpson, at this time no longer living, but long a picturesque Congressman from our district. This gave the story a small fillip, aside from the human interest involved in the tragic death of a neglected but loved baby.</p>
        <p>Jerry Simpson, mentioned earlier in this chronicle, native of Medicine Lodge, had been well known throughout the country by reason of his rough-and-ready championship of the perpetually underprivileged farmer, and for the circumstance that he did not wear socks, considering them a vanity fit for bloated boodlers and bankers. It was he who, when a naval appropriation was under consideration, rose to a point of order and demanded, "What do we want a navy for; to plow corn with?" This and similar outbursts endeared him to the plain people of the plains, and assured him reelection so long as the Populist party should exist.</p>
        <p>__________It was after Thirty on the AP wire, and Erickson, the telegraph editor, was sitting with me in the city room, in morbidly pessimistic conversation about the state of the nation, before going out to have a final bowl of chile con carne on our way home and to bed. Fire alarm. Location, a broomcorn warehouse on South Santa Fe avenue.</p>
        <p>We decided to go on our bicycles. We paced a fire truck out Fast Douglas avenue, south on Tremont street. Behind the Carey Hotel was an express stable. One of the big wagons was parked in the street, rear wheels against the curb, tongue high in air. It was an unlawful and dangerous menace to life, especially as the 
        <pb n="184" />street was pitch dark. But, as usual, I should have been watching the road ahead instead of looking down.</p>
        <p>My front wheel, going at fire department speed, hit the truck wheel, and I hurtled high in the air. My head struck the high seat, bending its iron rail. I dropped to the pavement, streaming blood.</p>
        <p>Erickson picked me up, laid me on the sidewalk, hurried to a livery stable, called the office. Arrangements were quickly wade. The office called Dr. Dorsey, the oculist who had fitted me with glasses, as it was evident that the major damage was suffered by the jinxed left eye. I was transported to the doctor's home, where we found Dorsey in his nightgown, washed up, ready to perform.</p>
        <p>The patient oculist picked fragments of the left lens of my glasses out of my eye, and from the space above the eye. That took a long time, and there was no anaesthetic. When he was sure no more fragments of glass were inside, he washed out the cavity and took six stitches with domestic needle and thread, to fasten the upper eyelid in place. It was daylight when one of the reporters took me to my room on his bicycle handlebars.</p>
        <p>The injury healed, and the bad eye was not much worse than it had been. I put in a claim, in person, to the attorney for the express company, for the cost of a new pair of glasses, the oculist's fee, a new bicycle and a new suit.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, named Gardiner, whom I afterwards learned to like, was unnecessarily nasty about the whole procedure, and tried to beat me down. I told him pay immediately or stand suit. My lawyer brother had wired from Omaha, warning me against any settlement until he had learned details and filed a damage suit.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, knowing my claim was trifling in comparison with damages I could collect in court, made out a check, grumbling and growling. I suppose this was an act, to impress me with the nobility of his client in paying me anything at all.</p>
        <p>When next I met Van, on one of his visitations at the farm, he abused me roundly for a clodhopper and a greenhorn for having settled a two thousand dollar case for something like eighty dollars. He wanted to sue anyway, and knew how to do it, but I would not consent.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXII">
        <p>It was about time to have a professional card printed. The Eagle operated a job print shop which made a handsome profit. Its manager was an affable fat man, friendly toward me. He evidently thought, as did several of the executives, that I was set for a newspaper career, which, of course, meant a career with the Eagle and the Murdocks. I had a fairly good knowledge of type by this time, having selected types for this and that for a number of years. I leaned toward the simple, thin types for personal matter. I picked my types and stock, specifying the ink, and the words:________________________Charles B. Driscoll(italic} What's New Today?</p>
        <p>Wichita Eagle________________________Five hundred of these cards, on good stock, cost me little. The job department was not out for profit in the case of an enterprising reporter.</p>
        <p>I handed cards out freely, wherever I went. I made a point of visiting at least one office, store, factory or hone where I had never been before, every day. The cards, because of their naive enterprise, amused or interested the customers. I never left a new place without a story. Thus I enlarged my beat, which became the town. For a long time I had been turning in more copy than Otho P. Meyers every day.</p>
        <p>Meyers did not resent this. He was secure. He had everything he wanted in the newspaper field. If a younger man could outdistance him in wordage, he accepted the fact with a tolerant smile, as he smoked his pipe and made cynical comments about the
        <pb n="186" />leading citizens, in a well-modulated tone.</p>
        <p>The Catholics wore about the business of building a cathedral. They had worshipped in a horrible architectural monstrosity known as the Pro-Cathedral for many years. A Pro-Cathedral is a church that serves for, or instead of, a cathedral. When the Catholics consecrate a genuine cathedral, it is supposed to last forever, or until that day when Gabriel blows reveille.</p>
        <p>Bishop Hennessy, officially His Lordship, the Right Reverend John Joseph, by the Grace of God and the Favor of the Holy Apostolic See, Bishop of Wichita and Administrator of Concordia, was about to give the customers a preview of the ambitious new structure, to get things rolling. As the only Catholic on the staff, I was assigned to cover for the Eagle, long known as a friend of the Catholics, for some reason I never understood. Perhaps Hennessy, who was a stout tippler, and Old Harsh Murdock, a giant with the bottle, had been close pals in an exclusive sort of way.</p>
        <p>Hennessy, at this time, was grotesquely fat, purple in the face, and a constant sufferer from gout. He was a notoriously holy man, intolerant of all sin, the Devil, Protestants, and more especially Christian Scientists and Socialists. He had announced from his pulpit that no member of the congregation who voted for a Socialist would be eligible to receive the last rites of the Church at the hour of death, and could not be buried in consecrated ground.</p>
        <p>These things sound impossible today, but they were, they happened, and I am awitness.</p>
        <p>I was assigned to the celebration, more social than religious, since the church had not been dedicated. I arrived late, as I had neither time nor stomach for reception lines and small talk. To my surprise, I saw that His Lordship, instead of circulating among the customers in a black cassock, as almost any other bishop would have been doing, was sitting in royal state on a jury-rigged throne in a corner of the big, barn-like, unfinished structure. The ladies of the parish were serving lemonade at rough tables on the unfinished floor. There was no altar, neither was
        <pb n="187" />there a pew, a sanctuary, or anything else to subtract from the princely fol-de-rol the Right Reverend Ordinary was putting on.</p>
        <p>Since my office had told me to get an interview from the bishop, I hunted outthat dignitary, and started to walk up and ask questions, as I would of any other person, royal or lay. My arm was gently caught by Ted McDonald, who was acting as a sort of equerry to His Lordship.</p>
        <p>Now Ted, a bald, fat, mustached, smiling traveling salesman, had married into the wholesale liquor business and family of Getto, and therefore, under rules then and there existing, was not eligible to join the Knights of Columbus. This bar to temporal and spiritual glory was irksome to Ted, who loved nothing so much as to be portly and portentous in public places. In fact, so much was he annoyed by this discrimination against booze merchants that he regularly refused to give up his rented pew, near the front of the church, to the Knights when they received Communion in a body, one Sunday morning each month.</p>
        <p>But Ted had announced that hï¿½ was going to make a magnificent gift to the new Cathedral, a marble altar, thirty feet high, and today he was harvesting the first fruits of the glory that was to be his as a result of his sharing his liquor profits with the Lord, even though times had been bad with him since Carry Nation and Henry J. Allen had aroused the Baptists to a foaming fury against King Alcohol. It was against the law to sell liquor, end one had to take certain chances in a wholesale business of this kind. Yet Ted was going to do something handsome for the great new temple of worship.</p>
        <p>So one might not walk right up and shake the pudgy ecclesiastic by the hand as a preliminary to an interview. One had to be formally presented by Ted.</p>
        <p>As this was not a ceremonial occasion, so far as I could observe, I did not kneel or kiss the episcopal ring, but immediately stated that I was a reporter for the Eagle, and wished to ask a few questions concerning progress of the work, probable cost of the project, and so forth.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="188" />His Lordship cast a sickly eye upon me, and, in almost inaudible tones, asked, "Are you not the son of Florence Driscoll, the farmer?"I confessed, and I did not deny.</p>
        <p>"And you are going to the Quaker school, across the river?""I am a senior, or will be this fall, at Friends University."Then the thrust, with unctuous piety:"Do you know your religion?"Booze Tycoon McDonald was relishing this.</p>
        <p>I replied with a brash dignity that surprised me no less than it shocked His Lordship, "Yes, I do, but I shan't discuss it at this time. I am here as a reporter, on duty. May I ask a few questions?"Disquieted, the mighty man gave lazy and almost incoherent answers, and soon referred me to one of his underlings for details with which he was unfamiliar. I had my interview, nevertheless.</p>
        <p>When the Cathedral was ready for dedication, I had a major assignment on my hands. Precursor of the great festival of religion and rejoicing was a new priest, stout, affable, capable Father S. J. MacCorry, who came from New York to serve as an assistant to the Rector of the Cathedral, with the special duty of managing arrangements for the dedication. MacCorry had been a member of the Paulist order in New York, and was said to have been a professional actor before studying for the priesthood. He was a great showman. He planned a stupendous spectacle for the dedication. Wisely, he went to the Chamber of Commerce with his plans, and permitted himself to be cajoled into having the dedication during Fall Festival week, just to accommodate the business men. That would insure a whopping crowd in the town, whether the Festival clicked or not. Also, it would add a colorful note of pageantry to which Wichita was a stranger.</p>
        <p>With the merchants solidly behind him, MacCorry proclaimed Catholic Week for
        <pb n="189" />the city, and the day of dedication as Catholic Day at the Fall Festival.</p>
        <p>The lead in all this unprecedented spectacle was to be James Cardinal Gibbons, Private of America. The grand old gentleman of Baltimore accepted the invitation.</p>
        <p>Wichita had never seen a Cardinal. Gibbons had been the only one in the United States until a few weeks before our dedication, when a second dignitary had been raised to that position by the Pope.</p>
        <p>The president of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad loaned his private car, which was attached to regular trains and came into Wichita over the Missouri Pacific. My paper made arrangements for me to meet the Cardinal at the state line and ride the special two hundred miles into Wichita.</p>
        <p>I had a new pack of cards printed for the occasion. Instead of "What's New Today?" the line read, in scarlet ink, "Welcome Cardinal!" These cards had an eye-stopping quality that did me good service. All of the entourage, and the old gentleman himself, were immensely pleased, and few failed to remark upon the courtesy and enterprise indicated.</p>
        <p>I found myself in a car filled with high prelates. I was invited to have dinner in the Cardinal's private dining room, along with four bishops and His Eminence. The rest of the clergy of the entourage dined in a second special car, traveling next ahead.</p>
        <p>I must have appeared quite an oaf to the visiting dignitaries when I turned down my glass to the wine server. The Cardinal asked politely whether I preferred some other wine to the white sauterne. I said, "No, thank you, Your Eminence; in Kansas we do not drink intoxicants.""But this is a very light wine, in no sense intoxicating.""It is against the law to sell any alcoholic beverage in this state, or even to have it in one's possession," I explained. "My father makes wine from his own grapes, but Mother doesn't like to have us drink it.""Is beer also forbidden?" 
        <pb n="190" />"Yes, indeed.""Well, that is a bad law. It is not right to deprive a working man of his beer. I don't see why the working people stand for it."There was talk of high diplomacy among the prelates. The Primate told of the friendly situation existing between His Holiness and the President, of his high satisfaction with the government's handling of the Philippines, especially the settlement with the friars. At no time did anyone say to me, "None of this talk is for the newspaper."But, when the meal was finished, the Cardinal invited me to sit alone with him on the back platform, which was glass-enclosed. As we sat down, he lighted a Havana cigar. He offered me a cigar, but I explained that I did not smoke. Then he settled back in his seat and said, "Now for the interview."This was sufficient notice that all that had gone before was off the record. The old gentleman was then seventy-nine, but spry as a rabbit and bright as a new dime. He answered all my questions, which had to do chiefly with the supposedly growing friendship and tolerance among Christian churches. He asked me more questions than I asked; all about our town and state, about my parents, and my own ambitions.</p>
        <p>When I returned to the office, I was told by Doze to "take the sky," the much-desired permission to use all the space you want. I wrote a whole newspaper page of news, interview, and impressions. So great was the satisfaction of the church people that I was given every opportunity for interviews and proper coverage of the ceremonies and festivities that followed.</p>
        <p>There was a great procession through the principal streets, a public reception at the Wichita Club, a celebration at a public auditorium, speeches, brave music and lectures. At the public reception, thirty-three bishops and archbishops, constituting one-third of the Catholic heirarchy [sic] of the United States, were in line.</p>
        <p>I took Mother, who was overwhelmed by the pomp and splendor, and intensely
        <pb n="191" />happy to meet such an array of holy men. When we reached the Cardinal, he stopped the line, blessed us, and told Mother that she should be proud of her smart son, who, he declared, knew as much about the Church and its ritual as many priests. This in the presence of Bishop Hennessy, who had asked me so scornfully, only a short time before, "Do you know your religion?"Tears of pride and joy ran down Mother's face as she thanked the Cardinal, and the line moved on. The editor of the Eagle had, later, personal letters from the Cardinal and the management of the dedication festivities for the manner in which all things had been conducted. We printed an English translation of the entire dedication ceremony, and texts of all the principle sermons and speeches.</p>
        <p>On the most Catholic morning of all, when most of the paper was taken up with the story of the dedication, one of those unfortunate things happened. On page one, beside the big spread about the ceremonies, appeared, under a fairly prominent head, a news story of a priest in some distant city who had somehow disgraced himself. Nothing could convince the Catholics that that wasn't done with malice. They didn't blame me for it, but by that bit of bad taste the Murdocks, who, of course, were not to blame, lost most of the prestige they had gained by icy reporting of the religious news.</p>
        <p>Whether placing of the item on page one and next to the church story was a result of malice on the part of someone in charge of makeup, I do not know. There was some anti-Catholicism in the composing room, and just a mite of it in the editorial department. However, such things can happen by accident, and often do.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXIII">
        <p>The senior year is a serious time for all thoughtful students. The end of idyllic college days is ahead. There is an impressive realization that little has been learned, compared with the vast store of knowledge that has not been touched. Precious friendships are involved, and, with many, there is an urge to settle the problem of engagement and marriage.</p>
        <p>I had determined not to marry for several years, and was half decided upon permanent bachelorhood. Two girls in the school had a powerful appeal for me. Perhaps I would have asked Liquid Eyes for an engagement, as so many were doing with their favorite girls, except for the ever-present realization that it would be a long time before I could support a wife.</p>
        <p>I had abandoned hope of a medical education, to follow graduation at Friends. Teaching, too, had retreated into the background of abandoned ambitions, though I had a strong taste for the academic life, and almost envied those whose daily work permitted them to associate with men of learning.</p>
        <p>For me now there was one course: journalism of many sorts, newspaper work of all kinds, possibly leading in time to magazine work and beautiful letters.</p>
        <p>My interest in campus activities rapidly vanished as newspaper work crowded it out. I did, however, take an interest in a proposal that somebody write a college song. The only song we had was a parody of one used by some Eastern university.</p>
        <p>So I wrote "The Song of a Loyal Heart."Edgar Carver set it to music. Edgar was one of the smallest students of either sex. He wasn't a midget, and that covered his case. He had been traveling the world, as a musician in Ringling's circus. Indefatigable Benny Truesdell spotted him at a performance of the circus in Wichita, learned that Eddie was a native of England, offered him free tuition and some kind of a musical job if he would quit the circus and help Benny organize a college band.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="193" />Eddie, commonly known by the campus name of "English," organized a fairly good band, which flourished for years. Truesdell set him to work on "The Song of a Loyal Heart." Eddie didn't do a good job. He rearranged for it the music of an old hymn, but it proved difficult to sing. However, the college suffered along with it for several years. It was beautifully published at Truesdell's expense, and sold enough copies to repay his outlay, plus a little surplus for some college fund.</p>
        <p>Billy Sunday was coming to town, to conduct six weeks of revival. His advance men had been working in Protestant churches for months, along lines standardized by Sunday and his crack business organization. Sunday was getting a lot of national publicity. Many newspapers and magazines had told of his picturesque method of snatching souls from the burning, and had published pictures of him as he tore off coat, tie and collar, jumped about the stage, and ran over the press tables to great sinners who repented publicly with tears and protestations.</p>
        <p>Of course, Wichita wanted Billy Sunday, but could it afford him? The business managers laid down conditions. It would be necessary to build a tremendous tabernacle, plans for which, standardized by experience, would be furnished by the Sunday organization.</p>
        <p>All Protestant churches in town must close for the revival period. All agreed to this except the Episcopalians. Billy was accustomed to the holdout of this sect, so his men said that God could get along without Episcopalians. Christian Scientists were anathama to the revivalist, and were not asked to cooperate. Billy didn't consider them Protestants, but organized servants of the devil.</p>
        <p>I was given full charge of the Sunday campaign for our paper, since it would fit well with my school hours. During the revival I was freed from all other assignments.</p>
        <p>I attended every session, afternoon and evening, reported the sermons, the wild hysteria of the faithful, and names of all prominent converts. The sermons were
        <pb n="194" />handed to me in advance each day, but I had to report deviations from and additions to the standard text. Billy delivered the same sermons in every town, a custom followed by nearly all evangelists and missionaries.</p>
        <p>Sunday was a likable individual, with a good showman's facility in making friends. He and I became close companions, since I was the only reporter who covered every meeting and every detail of the revival, from beginning to end. Other reporters came and went. I was the only Catholic on the job.</p>
        <p>On the first night, Billy, at an appropriate moment, walked out on the press tables, shook hands with the reporters, and asked each one whether he had been saved. I merely said, "I'm a Catholic." Billy said that was good, that Catholics were good servants of God, and that he would not make any passes at me during the meetings. All the other reporters, at some time during the revival, joined the mourning mobs of penitents and shook Billy's hand as a token of salvation.</p>
        <p>I was often invited, after meetings, to the residence that had been set aside as home for Billy, Ma, and some of the bigger stars of the cast. Lemonade was served, I interviewed this one and the other, Billy changed out of the sweaty, wrinkled, almost ragged clothes that he had practically destroyed during the meeting, and took a shower and a rubdown.</p>
        <p>To each session the middle-aged ex-ballplayer came in a freshly cleaned and pressed, well-tailored suit, with neat shirt, collar and tie. From each meeting he departed in tatters, looking like a tramp. His holy gymnastics were not suited to citizen clothing, but to acrobatic attire,The Sunday meetings were first-page stuff, every day of the six weeks. There was no lack of news, aside from the sensational text of the sermons. There were many notable converts to Jesus, but the most conspicuous and sensational conversion was that of Henry J. Allen. Henry sat almost every night among the prominent citizens on the stage. But his conversion, managed with faultless dramaturgy, was postponed until the frenzy of the meetings had reached the grand climax,
        <pb n="195" />more than half way through the six weeks period. It was on a night of attendance.</p>
        <p>Henry's circulation had suffered sadly during the big battle over the hidden room, recall and the waterworks. Now he came forward while the immense choir sang, "Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling." He grasped Billy's hand, the music ceased upon signalled [sic] command from the director, and the newly saved Henry made a speech. He cried a little, admitted he had been a sinner, and promised to sin no more. He did not neglect to put in a plug for his paper. He said it would be better than ever now, with God for associate editor.</p>
        <p>The audience went wild. Henry had been something of a public scandal to the righteous because of his seemingly incurable tendency to consume more alcohol than almost anybody else in town, and the Peerless Princess of the Plains was well supplied with notable exponents of the business of falling in the gutter in full dress after a high-toned evening party.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Attorney Sam Amidon, the town's most eloquent and wealthy lawyer, himself notoriously living in sin with an attractive little lady from a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, had rented the Forum, Wichita's new and commodious public auditorium, at his own personal expense, to tell a wildly applauding audience, admitted free of charge, how Henry Allan had become drunk in his (Amidon's) home, and had ruined the expensive oriental rug, at a private party, and then had, while suffering from a tremendous hangover, written his best editorial. It was a ringing denunciation of prominent citizens who served liquor in their homes.</p>
        <p>Sam told his audience of five thousand anti-Allen folk that he served good liquor in his house, and that it was not his fault that Henry had become ill. He said he would never have mentioned the ruined rug if Henry had not written that editorial, aimed directly at him.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Sam had nothing to do with the Sunday revival. He professed no religion, but for many years had a pew, rent well paid in advance, in the Catholic
        <pb n="196" />church. He attended High Mass every Sunday, because his chunky little wife wished him to attend. She was a devout Catholic, daughter of one of the leading department store proprietors, dignified, chin-whiskered Mr. S.E. Noyes, who brought a lot of culture into the town from Back East. Sam never brought his mistress to Mass. During the rest of his active life, Sam Amidon hired the Forum for one evening each year, and spoke to the biggest audiences that could be accommodated, approximately five to six thousand people, and the subject was always the same: Henry J. Allen. Sam was a tall, bony, awkward person, with a loud voice, convincing manner, and no knowledge of English grammar or syntax. Allen never replied to the attacks, and knew better than to sue for libel. Sam even won a libel suit for the Eagle after the paper had admitted, in print and in court, that it had spoken untruthfully when it accused a city commissioner in headlines across page one, to this effect: "SAM STEWARTGRAFTED FROM CITY FOR PRIVATE GAIN."After his conversion, Allen's fame among the righteous grew tremendously. His circulation shot up. God was on page one every day in some capacity. Church newsovershadowed everything else.</p>
        <p>The Murdocks, who were not known as church-going people, would have nothing to do with the Sunday show, which they considered undignified, commercialized exploitation of religion. While the show was on they occasionally attended an Episcopal church. Marcellus attended one performance at the Tabernacle, out of curiosity, and sat in the audience, inconspicuously. When personal workers swarmed over him, asking him to come to Jesus, he merely shook his head in an embarrassed [sic] manner and asked them to be good enough to pass along.</p>
        <p>In one of his final sermons, Billy Sunday described heaven in intimate detail. He said that Jesus had prepared some grand mansions there, but that those prepared for Christian Scientists would remain vacant, since the Lord would have nothing to do with such dirty people. He even quoted Jesus, who would say to Billy, "That grand mansion you see up there I prepared for a Wichita man, but he became a dirty old
        <pb n="197" />Christian Scientist, and now is in hell. The place is for rent."I was happy to be included in the distinguished company that, Mr. Sunday assured us, would be shown about the Holy City on a personally conducted tour, by no less a personage than Jesus Himself, Who, the evangelist assured his audience at all times, was a familiar friend of his.</p>
        <p>"I'll be waiting there by the gate for my dear wife," he said, "and along will come our dear Henry Allen and this good Catholic reporter, who has done so much for the glory of God, and Jesus will take us out for a walk, and show us all the sights and the mansions." It sounded a bit like the tours of Chinatown, which I afterward encountered in New York, but it made an immense hit with the audience.</p>
        <p>Sunday went away with a tremendous bag of cash, but the bag of-souls was considered by most of the pastors to be worth the price. None of the churches participating in the soul-saving contest had lost any money. Certain collections were divided among them in accordance with an agreement drawn and signed before the meetings began. When a sinner gave himself to Jesus at the big orgies, he was required to sign and fill out a blank for name, address, and choice of church affiliation. These blanks were distributed among the ministers, and it was up to those holy men to go out and get their legitimate share of the converted customers after the tumult and the singing died. A year later, in the light of experience, most of the reverend pastors of souls were chiefly impressed by the preponderance of backsliders among the supposedly saved.</p>
        <p>The commercial aspects of the great revivals disturbed many of the faithful. Billy Sunday repeatedly announced that he would accept no money for himself, except the collection on the final day and night of the revival. That seemed more than fair.</p>
        <p>Surely, here was a saint. He would work six weeks, saving souls from hell, for nothing, and then accept one day's pay!</p>
        <p>Two weeks before the close of the meetings, when a large sucker list had been built up, the machine started work on the "last night" fund for Billy in person.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="198" />Every convert and every business house in town was canvassed by experts, not just ordinary local church promoters. Such intensely religious citizens as A.A. Hyde, the Mentholatum man, and E.C. Coleman, the gasoline-gas lamp man, who often publicly acknowledged that their business successes were wholly due to prayer, were asked to sign at the top of the list, with amounts opposite. They did so, gladly and generously.</p>
        <p>Other business and professional men were visited in order of importance. There was no secret about the publicity that would attend announcement of their contributions. Thus a holy blackmail, in the Name of God and Billy Sunday, operated on precision lines. The ultimate take was never totalled [sic] in public print. But the best scuttlebutt in Christian circles said that the reverend ball-tosser went out of town with forty thousand dollars net under his personal belt, for six weeks of the kind of work that nobody else could or would do for Jesus.</p>
        <p>Billy's personal one-night collection was but a small item in the total cost of the enterprise. Homer Rodeheaver, slide trombone evangelist, who was handsome in such a holy way that he won to himself an embarrassing number of female souls at every town in which he appeared, had the hymn-book concession for the show. This was worth not less than twenty-five thousand dollars for a session such as the one in Wichita. As these lines are written, Rodeheaver, living in splendor in Indiana, is one of the richest of the musical servants of God. His hobby is rearing and training, on an immense Southern ranch, polo ponies for the sportive and sometimes sinful millionaires.</p>
        <p>Other members of the cast had other concessions. There were many, and the money rolled in, showered down. Billy Sunday's personal fortune grew to be one of the largest that over came out of the business of saving souls for the lord. Billy had hard luck in his latter days. Certain domestic and public scandals for which he was in no way responsible, dogged his holy trail. He unwisely attempted, late in life, to convert New York. For the first time, he found his old enemy, Satan, so strongly
        <pb n="199" />entrenched that saving; souls was not page one news. The newspapers gave him thelaugh-off, and the Big Town gave him a polite brush-off.</p>
        <p>The last of many of his meetings that I witnessed was held in a small church in a little Long Island town. The powerful voice was gone. The magic of the old stories that had brought tears and prayers from countless thousands of sinners was no longer of any use. The small audience of well-dressed New Yorkers sat there, cold, unresponsive, pitying the old man whose name had once meant something in the world of soul-saving. Billy Sunday had lived too long.</p>
        <p>__________So we came to Commencement, and the painful Last Chapel, when most of us wept as we sang, "God Be With You Till We Meet Again."I had finished my four years' course in three years, with extra work and extra credits. I had worked hard outside of school; too hard. My health had suffered severely. Nothing in the life ahead would over be so hard as that last year in school. I was thin, pale, anaemic, scarcely able to stand through the ceremony of conferring of degrees. In black gown and mortarboard, I looked like a ghost.</p>
        <p>But I was granted the day off by the paper, and Mother was in the audience, more concerned about my health than about my academic honors.</p>
        <p>Mother and I took a trolley car back to town, after I had bade goodbye to my friends. I did not realize that I looked so ill until a kind, middle-aged lady arose and offered me her seat in the car.</p>
        <p>I went home to rest for the week-end. But there was no rest. When John and Mother had gone to bed, I wandered over the farm by moonlight, thinking, planning, longing for the smell of ink and the activity of the city room. I missed the roaring presses, the gay camaraderie of the staff, and the responsibility for a job that must be done. There was little nostalgia for the academic atmosphere. I had put that behind me when I had taken the inky trail. I thought about the sixty dollars that I owed the college for my last semester's tuition, and resolved to pay
        <pb n="200" />it before buying a new suit. I was vaguely troubled by thoughts of Liquid Eyes, and wondered whether I ever would see her again.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXIV">
        <p>Zach Taylor had worked on the Eagle before my time there, and returned briefly, while visiting relatives in Wichita, to fill in for someone who was ill. He had worked on papers in distant places, and was to me a man of the world. He had a pleasant way, did his work without apparent effort, and gave one the impression that he was capable of much more important accomplishment than this, town and paper could offer. He was a Kansan, graduate of the state university, and his real first name was Earle. But all newspaper Taylors are Zach, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which altereth not.</p>
        <p>A cub had recently joined the staff. He was Leo B. Bozell, also a University of Kansas man, and a whizz-bang reporter from the start. He and Taylor, within a few days, were close friends. They were fraternity brothers. Taylor recognized immediately that Bozell was a newspaper man who couldn't be spending much time in Wichita.</p>
        <p>Taylor wore better clothes than the rest of us. He had a ready smile, a friendly personality, and a way of brushing off people who did not interest him. He had no time for Burt Doze, whose conversation bored him. He did not kow-tow to the Murdocks, and seemed altogether careless of what they might think of him. His work was so well done that there was nobody to criticize it.</p>
        <p>Bozell and I were much closer than Taylor and I. I felt that I had not grown up to Taylor, while the old school tie held him and the intelligent cub together.</p>
        <p>Bozell, always called Boz, to rhyme with doze, was thin, extremely nervous, always on edge. His forehead was wrinkled and his cheeks starting old-age wrinkles when I met him first, and he was then only a few months out of college.</p>
        <p>Boz was never a good writer, but he was born a reporter. He had the professional 
        <pb n="201" />nose for news which required no instruction and no cultivation. His energy was such that it kept him always on the move, always thin and excitable. He had a stance that reminded one of the mile runner, waiting for the gun. This gave him stooped shoulders before he was twenty-six years old. He made extensive notes on any story, which I never did. His characteristic pose, when working on a story, was a deferential attitude, pad and pencil in hand, one foot far forward, as if about to run, asking questions and writing the answers. I worked with him on many stories. He could not understand my method. I never pulled out pad and pencil while talking to a source of information. I stood lazily, in an objective manner, and talked conversationally, as if it didn't matter whether the customer answered or not.</p>
        <p>Both methods of reporting are still used, depending upon the personality of the reporter.</p>
        <p>Bozell was a religious Episcopalian, sang in the choir of any Episcopal church that needed his voice, and only occasionally became embarrassed on festal occasions, such as Christmas, because of a preceding alcoholic celebration among members of the staff.</p>
        <p>The worldly Zach Taylor left us to accept a job as assistant city editor of the Omaha Daily News. He made fraternal promise to Boz before he left for Omaha. He had the self-confident manner. Boz was on his way.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, within a few weeks, Boz was summoned to Omaha, to take a job.</p>
        <p>I suspected that Boz, several years my junior, was moving along in the career business, a notch ahead of me. Still, I felt that I must move cautiously. I would endeavor to be sure of my footing before I tried to jump.</p>
        <p>__________Harold Callender was telegraph editor during part of my time at the Eagle. He rarely spoke to anybody during working hours, a characteristic not unusual in wire editors. He worked in a cubbyhole occupied by himself and the Morse code telegrapher, handled his copy efficiently, and did not even know the names of many inhabitants
        <pb n="202" />of the city room.</p>
        <p>Harold and I became friendly when he discovered that I had Socialistic tendencies. I hid been reading George Bernard Shaw and Scott Noaring, and had digested as much of Jack London and Upton Sinclair as I could take.</p>
        <p>It became a custom for us to adjourn to a chile con carne parlor on North Market street after putting the paper to bed at three o'clock in the morning. We would discuss the hopeless state of the world over the steaming chile until nearly dawn. Five cents a bowl did not seem too much for the excellent chile.</p>
        <p>Callender was far more pessimistic than I. He had no hope for Capitalism, and did not believe that there was any chance for a young man, especially in the newspaper business. He said that we reporters and editors tried to make ourselves believe that we were professional men, whereas we were mere wage slaves, working like fools for the profit of misters such as the Murdocks, who had small brains but large capital. We would never get anywhere. "Important people do things," said Harold, "and we try to feel important because we report what they do."I tried to direct a weak glean of hope and optimism into the murky clouds my friend created. He dismissed my suggestions as poppycock.</p>
        <p>Callender played tennis on courts in the neighborhood of his furnished room, so as to forget, for a while, the sad state of the Capitalistic world. A frequent partner was Bessie Stough, who was born and chiefly reared in the pink farmhouse directly across the road from the one in which I was born. She was now living in town, studying art.</p>
        <p>They were married, and for a while Harold took a more tolerant view of life. Presently he and his wife went to Kansas City, where ho took a job on the Star. We were destined to hear more of him.</p>
        <p>__________Myra McHenry was a mentally unbalanced old lady who frequented the editorialrooms of the Eagle. Her only claim to fame was that she was Carry A. Nation's 
        <pb n="203" />first active disciple. When Carry came to Wichita from Medicine Lodge, she had nointention of smashing liquor bottles. She had been having trouble with her husband because he had an appreciative eye for the younger and more comely ladies of MedicineLodge, and loved the strong Kansas winds that lifted the modestly long skirts to just the right height. Carry took a violent dislike to all good-looking women. She heard that there was a picture of a beautiful naked woman, known as Cleopatra, in the Carey Hotel bar, in Wichita. Men, with the same evil eye that cursed her husband, were rumored to have contracted a great liking for this picture by John Noble. Carry went to Wichita to do something, she did not know exactly what, to that picture. She would somehow get even with all beautiful women, especially the naked ones.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Nation alighted from the Santa Fe train in Wichita, on a cold January day in 1901, she picked up two stones and put them in her purse. She thought she might need them.</p>
        <p>A timid, harmless, Milquetoast brother-in-law of Proprietor Johnny Mahan, by the name of Parker, was bartender at the magnificent saloon. It was an off hour, and the young man was alone, polishing glasses. Mrs. Nation started upbraiding him, in the tone she was accustomed to use to her husband, for working all day in the presence of a naked woman, reflected as large as life in the big bar mirror.</p>
        <p>If Brother-in-law Milquetoast had been any one of a dozen stout Irish bartenders who served the dry Kansas public at that time, Mrs. Nation would have got the bum's rush, and history would be different.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by the silent nervousness of the bartender, Carry hurled a rock through John Noble's noble representation of "Cleopatra at the Roman Bath," and her aim was good. The canvas tore at a strategic point. The other stone followed.</p>
        <p>Publicity about this incident so intoxicated Carry that she went back, assisted by Sister McHenry, and smashed the saloon to bits. The two crazy old ladies carried hatchets, splintered the expensive mirror, broke bottles and barrels, and made the place look like a china shop that had been visited by a tornado and a bull. This incident catapulted Nation and McHenry into a publicity-seeking campaign
        <pb n="204" />that lasted for many years and eventuated in really drying up the state, so far as saloons were concerned. King Alcohol went underground.</p>
        <p>During my reportership on the Eagle, Carry Nation was non-existent or in some sort of institution. Mrs. McHenry carried on.</p>
        <p>She was a slight, wrinkled, dried-up old lady, with sunken cheeks, blazing brown eyes, and some species of Southern backwoods speech. She was proud of the circumstance that she made all her clothes and used rouge and lipstick. Because Henry J. Allen was the focal point of her hatred and the objective of her blackmailing attacks, she was smilingly tolerated at the Eagle office, and given handouts of small sums, in cash.</p>
        <p>Now, Henry J. and the Beacon were for prohibition, while the Eagle was againstit, though mealy-mouthed in any expression on the subject. Why, then, was Myra an ally of the Eagle, and a ranting street talker against Allen and his paper?</p>
        <p>I never knew the exact answer. I knew, however, that Doze and others at the Eagle handed Myra cash donations, probably in small amounts, while she was forbidden to enter the Beacon quarters. I learned later that Myra was a small-time black-mailer, and would denounce anybody on order, cash in advance.</p>
        <p>Myra got out libellous [sic] rhymes about Henry Allen, and had them printed on leaflets, headed by crude caricatures of Henry Allen. These she sold for a dime each to curious loafers who formed a circle about her when she started talking on the street, preferably in front of the postoffice, which was close to the Eagle office and the city jail.</p>
        <p>When Henry Allen owned the police department, Myra was hauled off to the clink as soon as she had a good crowd gathered about her. In spite of her age and frail body, she fought the policemen, bit their noses nearly off, scratched at their eyes, and kicked them where it would be supposed to hurt.</p>
        <p>With true Southwestern gallantry, the cops refrained from slugging the oldmaniac, but it often took five or six of then to land her behind bars, even with the
        <pb n="205" />aid of the Black Maria and a jailor. If the Murdocks were in power, a telephone call from the city desk freed the old woman after two or three hours. If Allen was running City Hall, she had to sweat it out overnight, appear in police court in the morning, and sometimes serve a few days. She was her own lawyer in these cases, called the judge vile names, denounced Henry Allen, and told dirty stories about the leading ministers of the city.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McHenry's favorite story about any minister of the gospel was that he had been caught in a bath tub with some woman. Obviously, she did not know about bath tubsï¿½or women.</p>
        <p>I was assigned to a dinner given at the Lassen hotel for the stars of the New York Metropolitan Opera company, then singing a week's season in Wichita. Henry Allen was toastmaster. He sat at the end of the speakers' table nearest the lobby of the hotel.</p>
        <p>Kyra McHenry appeared in the room, just inside the doors leading to the lobby, and addressed the startled guests.</p>
        <p>"I s'pose you all thinks you gittin' something fine when that ole Henry Allen talks to you-all! That ole thief! Why you-all don't know that he's an old chaser, do you? That ole drunken sot! That ole devil!"Suave Manager Gray, tall and dignified, stepped to the harridan's side and spoke in a low tone.</p>
        <p>"No, Mistah Gray, I won't stop talking'! An' if you call the cops, I'll have you arrested for runnin' a common ho-house! That's all this-here place is, a ho-house! And you sell cigarets, too, you ole hypocrite!"Two uniformed policemen closed in, picked up the frail old lunatic, and carried her out, screaming imprecations.</p>
        <p>Henry Allen did not change color, or by any sign recognize the fact that there, had been an unseemly interruption of the festivities.</p>
        <p>Next morning, Mr. Gray paid Myra's fine, and invited her to visit him in his
        <pb n="206" />office. When Myra arrived, the courtly Mr. Gray seated her, and said, "I've long wanted to have some of your poems and caricatures, Mrs. McHenry. I would value them for my collection, and to give to my friends. How many have you on hand?""Why, thank you, Mr. Gray, I have only about a hundred, but I'll have some more printed.""No, the, hundred will be enough for just now. Here's twenty-five dollars on account. If you will come around here on the first of every month, I think I can use a few more cartoons and poems."Never another word was uttered by the blackmailer about that hotel, other thanhigh praise for its manager. Twenty-five dollars a month was small potatoes, said Mr. Gray, and he was happy to have the old vixen easily taken care of.</p>
        <p>Once Myra started to give out some of her dirty talk about Catholic nuns in general, in the editorial room. I was rather militant about the reputation of the Church, and especially about the nuns. Although I was only a reporter, and without authority, I shouted, "You keep your filthy old lying tongue off the Catholic nuns; do you hear? I'll knock you across this room if I hear another word of such dirt out of you!" She struck an attack stance, saying, "I'll slap your face black and blue if you don't take that back!"I walked to one of the large windows looking upon William street, opened it wide. "Just touch me, and out that window you go, you bag of dirty bones! I'm not a Wichita policeman."She hesitated. "Get out of here!" I shouted, and chased her to the head of the stairs.</p>
        <p>The silence in that city room could be molded into ice cream cones when Ireturned to my typewriter. Doze was chuckling into his copy paper. Myra lived to be past ninety, a plague and a pest to the patient city. She
        <pb n="207" />fell down the courthouse steps one icy day and killed herself. The righteous und the sinners alike rejoiced.</p>
        <p>I had a lesson in crime coverage from the Master, Garland Ferrell himself.</p>
        <p>"Come on, Charlie," he said to me one Saturday afternoon in August. "We'vejust had a call that neighborhood dogs are digging up a human body in a corn-field, out on Central avenue. We'll have some fun."Obviously, our active editor was becoming bored with the business of clipping editorials and drinking whiskey. However, he took a good swig before we started out. He drove to the address, in a semi-rural neighborhood. A farmhouse was set back from the avenue half a block, tall cottonwood trees lined the way, and a patch of sweet corn, hardly half an acre, was between the house and highway.</p>
        <p>In the center of the corn patch the coroner was directing two laborers, who were digging with spades. Two city policemen in uniform stood idly by, uninterested.</p>
        <p>The odor was worse than unpleasant, and the weather was hot and humid. The head of a woman had been revealed. It had been covered by only a thin layer of earth, which the dogs had scratched away.</p>
        <p>Ferrell stood by, calling any attention to the hair, quality of blouse, and other details. Then he said to the nearest spade man, "There'll be a laundry mark on the inside of the back of the neck of that white undershirt. Cut it off for me." The workman did as directed. Ferrell wrapped the odoriferous token in a piece of paper and put it in his pocket.</p>
        <p>He motioned no to follow, as ha started for the highway.</p>
        <p>"Whoever killed this woman had to have a spade or shovel to bury her," he said.</p>
        <p>"Chances are big that he didn't carry one with him. You take the south side of the avenue, and I'll take the north. We'll stop at every houseï¿½there aren't manyï¿½and ask whether anybody has borrowed a spade during the last two weeks. The woman has been dead about that long."The third house on my side was occupied by Quaker Preacher Brown, who owned
        <pb n="208" />the farm adjacent to ours on the north, and had retired to this small plot. I had done him a favor once, and he was a neighborly gentleman besides.</p>
        <p>Yes, a man had borrowed his spade, saying he wanted to dig up some wild seedlings to plant on his lot downtown. That was two weeks ago today. He gave a careful description of the man.</p>
        <p>I called Ferrell, who was immensely pleased. We drove to the office. All laundries were closed, since it was now nine o'clock on Saturday evening. Ferrell copied the laundry mark, and told me to start calling proprietors of all the laundries in town, beginning with the biggest, which was across the street from our office. I get Rufe Cone, the proprietor, away from a card game and told him he must come down and open the laundry. We had to identify a laundry mark, which I read to him. Yes, that was one of his marks, he said. In an hour we had the name and address of the woman. In another hour I had ascertained that she had been "away on a visit" fro two weeks. Boy friend? Yes, and he answered Mr. Brown's description of the spade-borrower exactly.</p>
        <p>We had an exclusive Sunday morning crime story, with all details verified. Ferrell was in high spirits, and I felt that I had learned something about reportorial procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXV">
        <p>I had been corresponding with Bozell, enclosing clippings of my best news and feature stories, and keeping him informed on office gossip. He told me that he liked the work in Omaha much better than in Wichita, because the competition was keen and standards high. He was on general assignments, after having done police for a short time. I told him that I planned to visit Van in Omaha during my two weeks' vacation in the fall. He replied that I must visit the News and go out with him on an assignment or two, to see how they did it in the big town.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="209" />I was doing a string of correspondence for the Kansas City Star, the New York Herald, and two other publications. Thus I added a few dollars to my income. My salary had been raised to fifteen dollars a week. I was able, on frequent visits to the farm, to bring home some little things for Mother.</p>
        <p>John was not milking any cows now. Milk and butter were bought at a little grocery store on the southern edge of town. The old grocer, who was a thrifty retired farmer, said he bled inwardly every time he sold farm products to John, who had a big and productive farm on which he produced practically nothing. Nearly all the home acres were rented out.</p>
        <p>Irvine Staunton was a business man who suffered partner trouble, and was shoved out of the business by means which he considered crooked. He sat in his large home on the Hill and brooded. He consulted lawyers. One hot day in July he set out for a walk, and never returned.</p>
        <p>I picked up a police alarm fro the missing man, interviewed the wife and son, and we ran a complete story, with two-column picture. The search went on monotonously from day to day. The wife consulted a medium, who told her fortune for advertising.</p>
        <p>When the search had lasted three to four weeks, I interviewed the wife again. It was apparent that she had become mentally confused because of worry. The son also was in a state of nerves.</p>
        <p>Then came a telephone call from John Schweiter, son of old Henry Schweiter, saying that there was a dead person, who must have been dead a long time, in his cornfield, west of town.</p>
        <p>I told John to stand by the roadside, at the spot nearest to the body, and we would be out in a little while. Then I called Coroner McCollister, who called an undertaker and the younger Staunton. We met at the undertaker's, and all went to the spot in the utility wagon.</p>
        <p>The corn was higher than our heads, shutting off air circulation after you were
        <pb n="210" />ten feet into the field. The temperature was 110 in the shade. This was the thirtieth day since the disappearance of Mr. Staunton. The temperature had been over 100 every day. It had been our hottest August.</p>
        <p>I will spare the reader details of description. Upon coming in sight of the body, young Staunton let out a tremendous shriek: "I'm a son of a bitch!"He continued shouting this in a wild manner as he identified the body by articles gingerly extracted from what was left of the coat. While preparations for removal were being made, he chased some big, fat cats, making violent efforts to kill them, all the while shouting, "I'm a son of a bitch!"The coat had been rolled up to serve as a pillow. We all agreed that the man, walking aimlessly in an effort to work off some of his trouble, became exhausted by the intense heat and the lack of air, suffered a heart attack, lay down to rest, and died.</p>
        <p>The young man kept shouting the same meaningless sentence all the way back to town. Tears later I was told that he kept up the shouting at intervals, all the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>I was proud because I was the only one of the six men at the cornfield who did not become violently sick. McCollister explained that he "must have eat some bad bacon for breakfast." His professional pride was wounded.</p>
        <p>__________A one-armed Italian peanut vendor kept his whistling stand on the street corneroutside the Eagle office. He had been there many years, selling hot popcorn and peanuts to generations of reporters, compositors and pressmen, far into the night.</p>
        <p>He usually put away his gear and walker to his home on South Emporia avenue after two o'clock in the morning. One morning Tony was found shot to death on the sidewalk, not far from his home. Robbery The only clue the police ever found was a revolver with which the crime might
        <pb n="211" />have been committed. The weapon was picked up in tall weeds, several blocks from the spot where the murder took place. One bullet had been fired. The same calibre bullet was found in the body of the peanut man.</p>
        <p>Ownership of the revolver was traced to a certain young Italian. He was arrested on suspicion. This moron spoke hardly any English, and understood less.</p>
        <p>When the case came on for trial before a jury in District Court, I was assigned to cover. A jury was impaneled, and the County Attorney presented his case briefly.</p>
        <p>White-haired, handsome Judge Thornton W. Sargent, known as a stickler for justice, leaned forward and asked, "Mr. County Attorney, is that all the evidence you have against this man?""Yes, your honor.""I am surprised that you should bring a man to trial upon so serious a charge with such flimsy evidence, if it may be called evidence." The judge wrote rapidly in the Journal. Then, with some asperity, he said, "The case is dismissed. Mr. Sheriff, release the prisoner."I was sitting near the defendant, who didn't understand what was going on, butkept fidgeting and turning pale and red alternately. Just as the Judge addressed the Sheriff, the prisoner jumped to his feat and shouted:"All right, Your Honor, I done it! I keeled him! But I didn't mean to! He has throw ope only one arm when I tell him hands ope! I thought he reach for gun, so I shoot! Mercy, Judge!"The prisoner sat down, pulled by the Sheriff. Silence in the court.</p>
        <p>Calmly, in a low tone, Judge Sargent said: "This is too bad. But no man may twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense. Release the prisoner, Mr. Sheriff."So far as I have been able to learn, this remains the sole instance in American
        <pb n="212" />jurisprudence in which a prisoner has confessed murder in the first degree in open court and been immediately given his freedom.</p>
        <p>__________A young man shot and killed his mother in a home in the North End. I went out with police, called by neighbors. It was Election Day, 1912.</p>
        <p>A neighbor heard the shot, and saw the young man, who had been crippled byinfantile paralysis, walk out of the house and down the street toward a trolley line, immediately afterward. He seemed to be hurrying.</p>
        <p>I looked over the layout, stole a couple of photographs, heard the neighbors' stories, and then set out for the Western Planing [sic] Mill, where the boy's father was employed.</p>
        <p>I asked the foreman to call this man from his machine, since I had bad newsfrom home for him. The father was a white-haired, kindly, ingratiating man of 60 or more years, stooped from a lifetime of labor over a saw. His clothing was clean and neat.</p>
        <p>"Your wife has been murdered," I told him. "Come, I will take you home."The man looked incredulously at me, stammered, and began to tremble violently.</p>
        <p>"Hurry up!" I said. "Get your coat and hat. I have a car outside."He shuffled over to his coat and hat, mumbled incoherently to the foreman, who said, "That's all right. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything and you won't even be counted absent.""Thank you, sir." And my man was beside me in the car.</p>
        <p>I asked him my questions. He answered as if in a dream. The son and mother had not got along well. The son was warped by his physical suffering and disability. He had been unable to get a job, and brooded over his idleness at home. His mother nagged him because he was an idler.</p>
        <p>"Are you sure she is dead?" asked my companion. "She'll live till I get home, won't she?"
        <pb n="213" />"She died instantly; one bullet between the eyes, one through the heart." When I had first entered the house the lady was still seated in the kitchen chair where she had been peeling apples. An apple was in her left hand, a paring knife in the right. A pan of apples in her lap.</p>
        <p>When I arrived with the husband, neighbors had laid the body on a couch. The old gentleman, grown many years older in the last hour, fell upon his-knees beside the couch, grasped the cold hand, and talked endearingly to his wife, not loudly, but between low sobs.</p>
        <p>He told her how good she had been to him, what a good breakfast she had made for him that very morning, and almost whispered that he wanted to follow her over the river soon.</p>
        <p>I had about all the information I needed. The police were scouring the city, they said, for the murderer, who would be recognized easily, as he walked with a bad limp and carried a cane. As I was about to leave for my office, 1 suddenly remembered that I had the victim's age only by hearsay, from neighbors. I stooped beside the kneeling man and said, "I forgot to ask you. How old was she?'The mourner looked at me with dull eyes, as if asking me to spare him.</p>
        <p>"Fifty-five," he said.</p>
        <p>Late that afternoon, the murderer limped into Police Headquarters, handed his pistol to the desk sergeant, and asked to be locked up. He would answer no questions. They took him directly to County Jail, as was the custom when murder was involved.</p>
        <p>I vent to the jail and was given permission to talk with the prisoner. I approached him in a happy-go-lucky mood, knowing that he wouldn't talk if I acted like an inquisitor.</p>
        <p>"I'm a reporter for the Eagle. Just thought I'd drop in and see whether they're treating you all right here.""Yes, only they won't give me any cigarets," said the young man, smiling pleasantly. He was an odd-looking boy of nineteen, tall, with a long head, horse
        <pb n="214" />face, slightly twisted into a strange grin.</p>
        <p>I went directly to the Sheriff and got a package of cigarets. This courtesy completely melted my interviewee.</p>
        <p>"The only thing I'm sorry about," he said, "is that I forgot to vote. That's one less for Teddy Roosevelt, and I sure do want to see him elected.""Where did you go after you shot her?'' I asked, in a casual way. "The cops were looking all over town for you.""Those cops are dumb. I just rode downtown and went to a movie. A good one, too. When I saw the movie twice I thought it was about time to turn in my gun. I couldn't gat away if I wanted to.""You must be a good shot.""You bet I am. I've done a lot of target practice, and I can take it away from any of 'em at the shooting gallery. Did you nee how I got her right between the eyes? And then, just to make sure, another in the heart?""Yes, I noticed that. But maybe you were standing close."Indignantly, he flared, "Close? Why, I was standing in the outside kitchen door, ready to go downtown. She was clear over on the other side of the room, peelin' apples. I just said, 'Take this, you old bitch!' and when she looked up I put one right where it would do the most good. She never knew what hit her.""I suppose she had made life unpleasant for you?""Yes, she was naggin' and 'jawin all the time, my sister is a nice girl. She's away visitin' in Illinois. She's comin' home today or tomorrow, and I wanted the house to be quiet and peaceful for her, so I just killed the old woman to stop the jawin'."I hurried to the office, wrote my complete story, with exclusive confession. When Editor Ferrell came in that evening, he was obviously tight. He spotted the murder story, called me into his office.</p>
        <p>"Was there any witness to this confession?"
        <pb n="215" />"No.""Then it's as libelous as hell. This boy has refused to talk to the police. Suppose his old man gats a lawyer, and the boy denies he ever made this confession, and denies that he ever killed the old woman? Where will we be? Over a barrel, that's where!""Yes, I know that's true in an ordinary case. But the case against this boy is open-and-shut. He gave himself up, handed in his pistol. There can't be any defense.""Can't, hey? Well, I've seen 'em go free with more evidence against ' em." Ferrell killed the confession altogether, and changed the story with savage strokes of the pencil, so that it was no story at all. Then he put a head on it, referring to the victim as an "aged woman." He couldn't have been far from 55 himself, and it was the corn whiskey that made him call that lady aged.</p>
        <p>When the story appeared, it was the dumbest news story ever credited to me. I was broken-hearted, but briefly so.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXVI">
        <p>My debt to Friends University was paid. I mean the sixty dollars for thelast semester's tuition. My real debt to that good old Quaker school is still heavy, though I have been happily trying to pay it off all my life.</p>
        <p>I went to Boss Ferrell and told him I had selected my vacation period. He said I had earned the vacation, and he hoped I'd got some rest. What did I plan to do with the two weeks?</p>
        <p>Going to Omaha to visit my lawyer brother and see a big city for myself. I had seen pictures, on the postcards Van had sent, of the skyscraper WOW building, eighteen stories high! The great Brandeis Stores seemed so big and complicated that I did not know whether I could ever find my way out of them.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="216" />"Have you ever been away from Wichita, Charlie?"Oh, yes! I had been on a train to Arkansas City to act as cashier at a prep school baseball game. I had been to Lawrence for social work in the University there. I had been to Lindsborg and Topeka for state oratorical contests in which I had taken part. I really had travelled [sic]. But none of these had been extensive trips, and it would be something new, riding on a Pullman.</p>
        <p>Well, Garland said, I would see Bozell and Zach Taylor up there. They would undoubtedly make me acquainted at the News office.</p>
        <p>I admitted that I looked forward to such a possibility. I thought it would do me good to learn something about newspapering in a big city.</p>
        <p>"They're sure to make you an offer. Taylor and Bozell both know that you're the best reporter we've got, and they will try to get their outfit to hire you. That's natural enough, and fair. We want to keep you here, and when you come back we might talk about a little more pay. Anyway, come in and sea me when you return."I agreed to that, and Ferrell changed the subject.</p>
        <p>"Are you planning to marry, Charlie? It's sort of to be expected, I suppose.""No, I haven't any plans. I'd like to marry, and I know at least one nice girl. But I won't commit myself until I have enough income to feed two. Or nearly enough, anyway.""Do you owe any money?""No, I just got out of debt.""Good. I wish I could do that. Was it bad?""Yes, sixty dollars I owed the university for tuition. I just saved out of my pay until I had it."Garland turned in his swivel chair to spit tobacco into a spittoon on the other side, near the wall, and was a long time turning back.</p>
        <p>"Now, Charlie, about this marrying business. When you're in love, you believe an awful lot of horse manure. But never marry a girl in the belief you have so much
        <pb n="217" />in common, that she will be a help to you in your career, or that she'll be proud of you when you accomplish something.</p>
        <p>"A woman will pretend anything to get her man. But after you're married she'll yawn when you start telling about your writing, your day at the office, or your ambitions.</p>
        <p>"All a woman cares about her husband's career is how much dough he can bringhome. Writing men generally marry several women, looking for one who will even read what they write, say nothing about understanding it or offering helpful criticism.</p>
        <p>"Every woman who's on the make in the cities knows that writing men are apt to be restless and unsatisfied at home, so they go after 'em. They sell the poor sons of bitches all over again on the notion that here's a woman at last that will furnish inspiration and encouragement. And the poor guy goes through it all over again. The more successful he is, the more unhappy.</p>
        <p>"Just remember this. Marry some woman that has nothing in common with you, one that can't read or write and doesn't pretend to know what you're writing about. Then you can have some intelligent conversation with the ones who really know something.</p>
        <p>I pondered all this wisdom in my heart. It helped me in my resolution to remain single, for the present at least. But a vague uneasiness about getting on with a career turned to positive resolution after an evening during which I looked hesitantly and furtively into a pair of interesting eyes.</p>
        <p>My vacation plans were discussed at home. Mother was sad. She said the Omaha people were sure to keep me there, or make me promise to come back. I said I hoped so, because I'd like to try myself in a real city. Mother argued that the Murdocks were good to me, and that they were notably fine people. But there was no conviction behind her plea.</p>
        <p>The matter of overnight travel in a sleeping car was troublesome to me. I
        <pb n="218" />consulted Marie, who had been clear to Erie and back on a Pullman. How to tip, how to get into and out of a berth, where to put my pocketbook, my clothes, and my ticket? What if the porter should forgot to wake me up on time, and I should be carried away out to Wyoming or somewhere? How to get back?</p>
        <p>Marie's answers were helpful, though I would not now place them on the same basis as answers from Ask Mr. Foster.</p>
        <p>As soon as the train started rolling, I hunted for the conductor. I found him in conversation with a trainman on the rear platform.</p>
        <p>"Are you the conductor?" I asked, rudely interrupting.</p>
        <p>"Yes.""Here!" I handed him a dollar bill. The conductor muttered and I raced back to my seat. That duty was done.</p>
        <p>I stopped the first porter who passed my seat, and gave him half a dollar.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, I thought each porter I saw was a different one, so I handed out a lot of coins before we reached Omaha. I had expert help in getting into my upper berth, and in turning on and off the tricky lights (which I still think are still unnecessarily tricky).</p>
        <p>Van and Bozell met me at the train in what I supposed to be the largest and busiest railway station in the world. It was one of the dirtiest and most ill-planned I was ever to have the privilege of visiting. The crowds were amazingly large, and I took for granted that this was circus day. Van afterward explained that the crowds were always that way.</p>
        <p>I went to Van's office in the Bee building, and was edified by his name in fine black lettering on the glass door:F.W. DRISCOLL LAWYERThe first thing Van confided to me was that he was broke, and that he would take me to lunch at a nice place if I would lend him two dollars. We went to lunch, but
        <pb n="219" />Van was disgraced because I complained of the service, of the cold coffee, tough meat and rancid butter. He said he had known me when I would take what was put before me and clean my plate. I explained that I had waited table and eaten in good places since then, and knew rotten food and bad service when I saw and tasted.</p>
        <p>I noticed that Van was greatly changed. He was fat, for the first time in his life, and the fat was unbecoming. He was pale, too, except for some redness on his nose. He said that he had been in hospital for weeks with typhoid. Yes, we had heard that at home, and Mother had sent money.</p>
        <p>Van told me how he had got out of the hospital sooner than he should have, by a smart trick he played on the doctors. They had told him that a urinalysis would determine whether he should be discharged on a certain day, but they were not encouraging. That day, Van's college friend, O'Sullivan, also practicing law, came to visit, and Van got him to fill the sample bottle. Results, the most surprised doctors in town. There was nothing wrong with this man; now let him go. But Van had stayed in bed in his room for a long time after his discharge.</p>
        <p>He was still apparently not altogether well. There were times during the day when he actually staggered in his walk, and his face became flushed. I confessed to him that I was worried about his health, and he said to forget about it.</p>
        <p>After a few days of observing phenomena that mystified me, I asked Van if he were drinking liquor or beer. He said no, he never touched the stuff. In explanation of my stupidity let me interject that I had never taken a drink and was not as familiar with symptoms as a bright boy should be. The first open saloon I ever saw was in Omaha. The word BAR in big letters, shocked me. Van took me into one of these places at Sixteenth street and Capitol avenue, called Mickey Mullins. He ordered something by a name I had never heard, and one for me. I tasted mine and put it down. I didn't like it. I told Van I was strictly against intoxicants, and would not drink it. Van drank it, assuring me that it was not intoxicating.</p>
        <p>"Put 'em on the cuff, Dickey," said Van. Mickey pulled down a long sheet, with
        <pb n="220" />many items, showed it silently to Van, and added the two drinks. We emerged into the sunlight, one elated, the other depressed and ever more mystified.</p>
        <p>Van's next confidence was that he was married.</p>
        <p>"I haven't said anything to the folks about it," he said, "because I'm not making a living yet, and they might think it was unwise for me to marry. But my girl and I have both waited a long time, and we decided not to wait any longer." Van explained the situation in detail. This was the girl he had talked about so much on trip to the home farm, and in his letters. She was employed as an attendant at the Detention Home while Van was there. Approximately his age, she came of a family in moderate circumstances in a little Iowa town. Catholic, yes. But Van did not put any emphasis on that. I learned that he had quit going to church.</p>
        <p>"We were on duty at the Home seven days a week," he said, "not much chance to go to church. And the damn priests up here don't know how to preach a sermon. I can take it or leave it alone."But they had been married in church, by a priest. Van often took me past the church, and sometimes we went inside and prayed, as Catholics do when they have time. He liked to point to the very spot where he and she stood and knelt, during the marriage ceremony.</p>
        <p>"It was during Holy Week, too," said Van, with humorous appreciation of the story. "I called up old Father Senne, the pastor, an awful old pot. He bawled hell out of me for even thinking of such a thing as getting married in Lent, and on Holy Thursday at that. I said, 'All right. Father, we'll run along. There's a Justice of the Peace in my building, an old friend of mine, and he'll marry us even if it happens to be Christmas'." So the roaring pastor got dispensation, and they were married, but not without a terrific lecture on intellectual pride.</p>
        <p>"Next Sunday I'll take you over to Glenwood, Iowa, where she works. She will continue in her job until we have enough to set up housekeeping here in Omaha."
        <pb n="221" />So we went to Glenwood on the train. In some sort of state institution for boys, whether feeble-minded or wicked, I don't remember, and perhaps never inquired. I met Margaret, a plain, good, hardworking woman, looking a good deal like an earnest and devoted schoolteacher.</p>
        <p>She was exactly that. She taught music to inmates of state institutions when there was a spot for such teaching. Otherwise, she taught whatever had to be taught, or merely took care of the unfortunates. She had a grand way with children. She was humble, self-effacing, and just now was wholly devoted to the ambition to help make Van a famous lawyer, a judge, and a husband to be forever proud of. She believed thoroughly in Van, and would at any time lay down her life for him.</p>
        <p>Van called her White Rabbit, though she was of the darker Irish strain, with black hair. She liked me from the first, and in the years that were to follow that friendship was never interrupted.</p>
        <p>How are things going down on the farm?" asked Van, when we were back in town.</p>
        <p>"Not so well as might be," I said. "Hardly any money coming in, and no hope of paying off the mortgage. They are very poor.""Nevertheless, I'm going to make a drive," said Van.</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?""I'm going down there and get some money. I've got to have money.""Oh, I wouldn't consider it," I replied. "They simply haven't any money.""Well, they'll get it. I'm going to make a drive."I learned that Van owed a lot of money. He had borrowed in small amounts, here and there, from all his friends. He had about run out of friends. Also, he had a personal injury case pending from which he expected to make a stake and pay all his debts. A telephone operator had been injured by falling on a corner of a counter when reaching too far to make a connection.</p>
        <p>The girl had suffered such severe injury that a hysterectomy resulted. Van hadtried the case and won a verdict for $30,000 in district court. The case was now on
        <pb n="222" />appeal, and Van had been obliged to ask another lawyer in on his side in order toget money for costs. But he still would have a tidy sum, when the Supreme Court upheld that verdict, which, said Van, it could not fail to do.</p>
        <p>I did all I could to dissuade Van from making another raid on the crippled farm, which, by this time, was suffering severely from these repeated demands. John was not altogether to blame for the slipshod condition of the down-at-heel farm. Repeatedly he had been forced to sell livestock, including needed horses to satisfy the apparently bottomless pit that Van was so industriously digging.</p>
        <p>A visit to the News office was enlightening. The paper, of an offside Scripps-Macrae chain called Cloverleaf, was patterned after the original Scripps paper, the Penny Press, of Cleveland, by this time graduated to the more dignified name of The Cleveland Press.</p>
        <p>The man who held the title of President and Editor was a tall, homely, long-nosed, slow-roving, pompous and not-too-literate business man by the name of Joe Polcar. His enemies, who were as the sands of the desert, said he was a Jew, but as to that I never knew or cared. Joe's brother was a junkman, and the city room was furnished largely out of his junkyard. The paper was having a tough struggle, what with the milking it was getting by the top boys.</p>
        <p>City editor and managing editor, largely the latter, was Paul Sisson, nervous,flighty, soft-spoken little fellow, natty in his dress, married to a woman of wealthy family.</p>
        <p>Paul was a college man; Polcar had no education whatever. Polcar kept Sisson in a constant state of fright and worry, blaming everything on him and raising hell with him in a loud voice after almost every Home Edition was off the press. This drove Sisson crazy. He was playing sycophant to Big Joe, as was everybody else in the plant.</p>
        <p>Sisson and Bozell were on the name nerve level, both overworking and over-worrying, both ambitious to get ahead. In fact, each worked upon the other, each
        <pb n="223" />stimulating the other to a more explosive nervous tension, and each spurring the other on to more work.</p>
        <p>I never have seen on office where there was so much apparent respect for authority. Everybody knuckled down to Joe. Sisson and his reporters and department editors frequently went on a drunk together, but next morning no hangover was accepted as an excuse. The staff kowtowed to Sisson as Sisson kowtowed to Joe.</p>
        <p>Boz introduced me to Sisson, who sat me down and looked me over appraisingly.</p>
        <p>"I've been reading some of your stuff. Good, but not our kind. We have to be brief here, and hit it hard. Boz and Zach have told about you. Do you want to join up with our chow?""Yes.""All right, I'll give you twenty dollars a week, and you can start to work tomorrow.""I'll have to say no to that. It wouldn't be fair to my present employers, and I wouldn't do it to you when I leave here. I'll have to talk to my people, also. I'll write you next week.""All right."Upon my return, I first told Mother of the Omaha offer and of my decision to accept it. I would try to get a little more money, and felt that I could.</p>
        <p>Mother was sad, but said that she knew it was inevitable. I would be out of her life, which had but a little while to run, she said, but she predicted that I would by no means stop in Omaha.</p>
        <p>"No," I said, "I have already decided that I am going to use Omaha as a school, to learn big town methods. Then I would like to go to Chicago or Cleveland, and eventually I will work in New York. I am going to work toward that goal."I had intended to follow the course of many of the alumni of the Wichita Eagle, in which the first stop was the Kansas City Star. The deviation northward was caused by the Zach Taylor influence. I still thought I might make the Star after a year
        <pb n="224" />or two in Omaha. I never did, except as correspondent, and long afterward, as syndicated columnist.</p>
        <p>Another talk with Ferrell, after my return. I told him that I was going to Omaha, and by that time, in an exchange of letters with Sisson, had agreed to accept twenty-two dollars a week and had set January first, 1913 as starting date. Several weeks remained.</p>
        <p>Ferrell offered every possible argument. He said the Eagle was willing to raise my pay to eighteen dollars a week, the highest paid to any reporter, and to Meyers only. Additional cost of living in Omaha would just about eat up the difference in Omaha, he said.</p>
        <p>Then he proceeded to paint a picture of the home-town boy who sticks to the home town and makes good. The friends, the high honor and respect.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I said, "like Farmer Doolittle."One more try. Garland warned me of the sharper competition in the town with deadly rivalry between and among five newspapers. I was tops in Wichita, where there was no competition. How I might do in the fierce struggle of the City he could not predict.</p>
        <p>I said, "Give me a chance at it. I'm not afraid of it."Ferrell changed his tone, reached his hand.</p>
        <p>"You're doing the right thing, Charlie," he said. "I had to say all that. It's my job. But I didn't mean a damn word of it. You don't belong here. Thank God that you didn't take my advice. Competition is tough, but you're up to it. Anyway, only the fearful and inadequate stick here because of competition elsewhere, unless there are family considerations that compel them to stay here. This is not a newspaper, but a handbill. You learned all there is to learn here during your first month."I was deeply affected by this frank talk.</p>
        <p>"I have learned a lot by association with you, Mr. Ferrell," I said.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="225" />"Call me Garland, Charlie."And so I did, ever after, with affection and gratitude.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXVII">
        <p>We had no evergreen trees on the farm. Big Flurry had considered them vanyties [sic], not practical timber in this hot and arid country that had such severe freezes in winter. But some of the neighbors had evergreens. Old Jonathan Balch had thaw, and the Simpsons, who could grow anything, and the house across the road, now occupied by the Browns, had large evergreens, planted long ago by the Morgans, infidels, but good farmers.</p>
        <p>As the Christmas of 1912 approached, and I, contemplating my approaching departure for the new life in the big city, spent more and more time at home on the farm, weekends and at other times. Mother planned this Christmas, which had a certain atmosphere of finality about it, even in prospect.</p>
        <p>I cut a small sycamore tree in the woods, three feet high, and asked the Browns for a few spare sprigs from their untrimmed evergreens. They gave ten times as much as we would use. Mother patiently cut sprigs of pine and bound them, with heavy linen thread, to the graceful limbs of the little sycamore. Candles on the tree, would be dangerous. So two holy candles, which, after all, may be used at religious feasts that have nothing to do with death, were lighted on each side of the tree, at a safe distance.</p>
        <p>It was a holy Christmas. Mother stayed up all night, feeding the dining room stove with wood, so that we might not be too cold when we arose at half past three to go to five o'clock High Mass. All of us received Holy Communion. I observed that Mother was so completely lost in prayer that she did not know when the Mass was ended.</p>
        <p>Those prayers were for the son who was about to go out into a strange new world. I have felt their impact until now, and God grant I may feel it always.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="226" />The families were at the farm for Christmas dinner. A fine turkey and two of our own chickens, with the matchless stuffing that Mother made so well with native sage flavor, made all the diners happy, in a resigned sort of way. After all, the family picture was not too rosy. The farm headed for bankruptcy; Marie with three babies obviously worried about the immediate future; Mother in bad health, with blood pressure creeping up; and the youngest son about to set off upon a lifetime's adventure, none knowing how it might fare. The absent brother an enigma concerning which only Mother had the confidences that shed any light.</p>
        <p>I went to see Big Flurry before setting out for Omaha. He had sold his farm that he bought from the Bishop, at a nice profit. He recognized the fact that he was getting on in years, and that he did not need to work any more. Pat Whaley had sold him a handful of the most worthless lots in town, just near enough to the railroad yard to be unavailable for residence, and just far enough away to be devoid of switching service. No good for anything, and subject to flooding.</p>
        <p>On one of these lots. Big Flurry, being about eighty years old, built, with his own hands, a stout little house, three rooms with bath, out of lumber which he sawed and nailed in place. A good enough shelter, said he, for any man who had never acknowledged the rule of king or bishop!</p>
        <p>Big Flurry could not understand clearly what connection there could be betweengoing to school the best part of one's life and, as he expressed, working for a newsPAPER. I was not even yet a printer!</p>
        <p>"Well, goodbye now, Charlie-bye, and God go with you," he said, as I left for the farm with the horse and buggy. He was vigorous still.</p>
        <p>I left on New Year's Eve for Omaha. John drove me to town in the buggy. I had a suitcase, and a small trunk was to follow when I had found a place to live.</p>
        <p>Mother, less strong than usual, remained in her chair when I kissed her goodbye. Her face was set, without a smile. But there was not a tear in her eyes. I carried my suitcase out to the buggy, and we were about to start rolling when 
        <pb n="227" />I heard the loud weeping, the shrill keening of the bereaved Irish, as I never had heard it before. One of my family came running from the house.</p>
        <p>"She is going to pieces!" I was told. "She says she will never see you again!"My heart was torn. I said, "There is no use in my prolonging it by going back to comfort her. Tell her I said I will be back soon. Maybe for Commencement in the spring."We drove on down the hill. The great windmill wheel was stirring restlessly.</p>
        <p>Bong-bong, bong-bong, long-long! That, and the piercing wails of the strickenMother followed me to the train.</p>
        <p>__________I did not click instantly on the Omaha Daily News. My first assignment was given by word of mouth, by Editor Sisson. "Go and get a New Year story from Reverand [sic] Savidge," he said. "He is a quack preacher around town; good friend of ours. He is going to drive the devil out of Fainting Bertha for a New Year stunt. He's at such-and-such an address."I found Rev. Savidge, a little lunatic with a dirty head and scraggly mustache. He talked readily when I told him my mission. Yes, he was going to hold a street meeting tomorrow, and start the year right by driving the Devil out of Fainting Bertha. She was a notorious pickpocket, convicted often, whose technique was to fake a fainting spell in a crowd and rob the people who came to her assistance. It is an old dodge, about worn out in cities.</p>
        <p>I wrote the story briefly and completely, but, not having seen the reverend fakir's name in print or writing, spelled it Savage. Called to the desk by Sisson, I got it this way:"Spell this man's name correctly. And if you ever spell another name incorrectly, you're fired."Genial Fred Carey, oldest reporter on the staff, always with an eye to educating the cubs, came to my desk. "I should have told you, Charlie,'" he said, "that this old son of a bitch spells his name Savidge. Always ask a man to spell his 
        <pb n="228" />name, no matter if it's Smith."That was good training. I have never misspelled anybody's name since that day.</p>
        <p>My desk, I should interject, was an old sewing machine frame from Brother Polcar's junkyard. The brackets underneath had been partly broken off with a sledge hammer, leaving sharp edges that tore my trousers and scratched my legs.</p>
        <p>I had been working on 'special assignments for two weeks, getting the stuff, getting it printed, and thought rather well of my work. One Saturday night Bozell, smoking furiously, came to my desk and said, "Charlie, Paul isn't altogether satisfied with your work. You'll get it, but it's best to get it quick. You have too much Wichita left in you. You write better than any of us; that we all know. But you don't write in the best Daily News style. You get all the facts, and do much better about condensing them than we expected. But you don't hit the story hard enough. Short sentences, few words, and a bang. That's what it a takes. Get the facts the other papers don't get. Then ram them home with that bang."I spent the next day reading my stories along with those of the seasoned News men. I saw exactly what Bozell meant. I began writing more Scrippsy than Old Man Scripps ever did. I liked it, too. It was fun to try to make the customers read your stuff, whether they wanted to or not. I began getting better assignments, and a rare smile and nod from Sisson. "That's good, Charlie!" was the top in encouragement.</p>
        <p>One of my secret weapons was humor. I would inject a humorous angle into aworkaday tale, especially if local politics were involved. I pretended not to be looking when Sisson, reading the copy, burst out laughing and called Boze, Taylor and Carey to read the funny stuff the cub from Wichita was putting out.</p>
        <p>In a bang-bang newspaper, nothing is more effective than a deliberate understatement. This often has the force of a bomb, and makes the dour customers laugh in spite of themselves. I was using an occasional understatement to make politicians look goofy.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="229" />
        <pb n="So they put me on police" />
        <pb n="The News was a muckraking paper. In those days, and to some extent today, the only way for a starving paper to attract attention and get readers was or is to fight for the underdog and expose the wicked in office. The most vulnerable arm of the public service is always the police. So far as my experience and observation has gone, and I've lived, with the subject a long time, all American cities have corrupt and inefficient police departments. I suspect that this may reflect a certain innate corruptness in the American people" />A newspaper may gain attention and readers by exposing graft in local government and stupid inefficiency in the police. But a wise editor knows when to saw off the campaign for righteousness and throw in with respectable corruption.</p>
        <p>My old friend, Garland Ferrell, once told me, many years after my pleasant service under him, "Charlie, the people don't want good government. They rejoice when you single out two or three crooks in public service and send them to jail. But they soon tire of righteousness. The worst reputation a newspaper can get is that of a common scold.</p>
        <p>"We once caught a county treasurer stealing tax money, in a big way. He had the goods on him, and, because he was a church man and a prominent citizen, the customers licked their chops while we fried him. He was convicted and sentenced. "The crowd had had its fun. It now turned against us. All around town the people ware saying, 'The Eagle is too hard on that poor guy. Suppose he did steal. They all do.' And, believe it or not, Charlie, they petitioned for a pardon, got it, and reelected that thief to his old job."The Scripps technique was to start a newspaper on a shoestring, publish it in a shack, raise hell, attract attention, pay starvation wages, except to those at the top, and, if possible, lose every election, so you could bellyache during another long period. Then, when you had the circulation that forced advertisers to buy space, turn respectable, brush off your old friends, and join the Country Club.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="230" />The program has not always succeeded. In fact, the outfit, with its auxiliaries, has hid far more failures than successes. And the few successes are all blue-nosed respectables, denouncing nothing more potent than murder and Communism, and very little of those.</p>
        <p>But we of the staff on the Daily flaws didn't know any of these inside machinations. We became permeated with a holy zeal, and of all the zeals, mine was theholiest and hottest.</p>
        <p>Few police reporters who stay on the job long are intelligent. On many largenewspapers I've known police reporters who couldn't speak ordinary eighth-grade English. But most of them are smart enough to shack in with the cops, the world as it is, and praise dumb detectives for solving crimes that they never solve. The police reporter who mentions names of cops praisefully gets the news. The cops give him tips on stories. But he has to ignore the wails and howls of the victims of the third degree, which he hears every day. He must not see the tremendous graft that a chief of detectives or a chief of police operates. If he knows that the commissioner of police owns a string of whore-houses that must never be raided, he cannot tell about it. And, if he is venal, he has plenty of opportunity to make several tines his newspaper salary on the side.</p>
        <p>That was police reporting in 1913, and that is police reporting today. So they made a police reporter of me, with brief indoctrination.</p>
        <p>This town, they told me, is run by a crooked old gangmaster, immensely wealthy, who has never held public office, and never will aspire to such low-pay jobs. He is Tom Dennison, old in years. Nobody knows how old, but he appears to be a hundred. He is seldom seen in public. He owns every public official in Omaha, and nearly every one in Nebraska. Some, of course, are in a mood of revolt. That is always true in a gang empire. But few dare say anything, few dare reveal anything, and they must have the protection of the newspaperman's honor. But you can find out a lot that you can tell.</p>
        <p>All of this was new medicine to me. I had never known anything about the
        <pb n="231" />police corruption in my own town, but had considered the police officials I knew as merely oafs, who didn't know whether it was Sicily or Holy Thursday. I lived to learn more.</p>
        <p>Especially did the picture seem almost unbelievable to me because Van had introduced me to the finest eating place I had ever know [sic], or would ever know. This was the second floor of a place called The Budweiser. On the street floor was a saloon. On the second floor was the restaurant. It was The Mandarin.</p>
        <p>On Saturday nights, when I felt that I had money to spend, and was hungry, I took Van to the Mandarin, and bought both of us a dinner. The finest steaks, sirloin, tenderloin, T-bone and porterhouse, that I have eaten in a lifetime of steak-hunting, I had on those Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>With the steak, rare, of course, since I had never heard of a civilized appetite that called for a steak cooked otherwise, we had potatoes au gratin. The steak weighed a little more than a pound and a half, or up to two rounds if a bone was involved. I always ate every bite of it, and all the delicious potatoes. Never was there a flaw in the service.</p>
        <p>Well, this place was owned by Boss Tom Dennison. In a small office, back of the restaurant, I was assured, Tom issued orders to his henchmen. To slug watchers at election booths, to hand down verdicts against his enemies, to pick juries sworn to him, to murder. It was hard to believe. Van took it all nonchalantly. He was then employed by some interests on the side of the gangsters who ruled the town. Yes, they bought juries. That was easy, especially when your men picked the jury lists, and only a few had to bribed, just to make sure.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="232" />In this place, on a notable evening, while I was eating my steak and potatoes, which, with side dishes and coffee, cost a dollar, I saw for the first time in my life a woman smoking a cigaret. I was shocked beyond expression.</p>
        <p>"Is that permitted in Omaha?" I asked.</p>
        <p>Van, speaking from a lofty pinnacle of sophistication, answered, "Of course. You'll see lots of it in this kind of a place.""But," I asked, meekly, "the woman is, of course, a prostitute, isn't she?" "Maybe so; maybe not. I don't know. Women who are not prostitutes sometimes smoke cigarets.""That can hardly be true," I said, and fell to contemplating my knife and fork.</p>
        <p>I never became acquainted with the notorious Tom Dennison. He was not easy to meet, and never gave interviews. He attended a public celebration once in a long while, in formal clothes and topper. On such occasions he was surrounded by gunmen, plug-uglies, detectives and bruisers. Nobody tried to pass through that screen, which was far better organized than the inefficient bodyguard of the late Huey Long. So Long died young; Dennison died holily in his bed, long after my time in Omaha, of old age.</p>
        <p>__________The job of police Judge, as in most cities, was a minor political plum, with low salary and not much chance for advancement. A man of about 32, Charles Foster, reticent and self-conscious, held the best of the police bench appointments. He was subject to chronic acne which disfigured his face. This may have been a cause of his reticence, bashfulness and self-consciousness. He tried to conduct his filthy little court in a dignified manner, but this was not always possible.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="233" />A big Irish cop brought in a street walker. She was tall, willowy, good-looking, and of very fair complexion. "What's the charge, Officer?""She's no good, Your Honor. Chief told us to bring her in. Solicitin' on the street.""Guilty or not guilty; how do you plead?""Why, Your Honor, it's ridiculous! This cop knows that I don't solicit on the street. He knows that I have a nice place, of my own, down here on Douglass street, right near the bridge, and that I have more friends coming there than I can take care of. He often sends me girls to help me out."The cop was red in the face, pawing the floor with his right foot, but came back.</p>
        <p>"She's a dope too, Your Honor."The judge looked sharply at the prisoner, at bar.</p>
        <p>"What have you to say to that? Are you a narcotics addict?""Why, the very idea! Of course not, Your Honor! I wouldn't think of taking dope!""She eats strychnine, Your Honor. She's eatin' it off her handkerchief right now, while you're talkin' to her. See how she puts her handkerchief to her mouth?""I can hardly believe that anyone eats strychnine," said the innocent judge. "How could she do that?""Lots of 'em do it, Your Honor. They soak up a strychnine powder in water and then let it dry on a handkerchief. They take nibbles at it whenever they get nervous or excited or when their man beats 'em up.""Is this true?" asked the Judge.</p>
        <p>"I take a little strychnine for my complexion, Judge," she said,
        <pb n="234" />"but that's not dope, it's medicine. You see what clear, white skin I have? The men notice me because I have such smooth skin. It would be awful good for them pimples on your face, Your Honor!"More scarlet in the face than even his normal scarlet, His Honor brought down the gavel.</p>
        <p>"Ninety days! Take her away! he shouted.</p>
        <p>__________Jack Ryder, a former newspaperman who had become a hopeless drunkard, was Commissioner of Police. A short, fat man, brusque, wealthy, completely subservient to the Boss, he had less interesting conversation in him than any other former newspaperman I've known..</p>
        <p>Once I was assigned to cover a typical Ryder binge. It was Election Day, and the bars were supposed to be closed. But Jack wanted more whiskey. He went up one street and down another, shouting orders to "Open up, Dog damn you!" and smashing windows, doors, glassware and chairs wherever the bartender refused him a drink.</p>
        <p>A large crowd followed in his train. Mostly, the crowd was made up of the curious public, watching one of its supposedly elected officers perform. But close to the flying coattails of His Honor were bodyguards and political advisors. These were trying to dissuade Jack from his Carry Nation antics, and were assuring him that there was plenty of drink at the Budweiser.</p>
        <p>"To hell with the Budweiserl [sic}" shouted the officer of peace. "I'll shash it up tool" But he didn't.</p>
        <p>The bawdy house business, one of the most profitable in Omaha, was divided generously by the Boss. Certain public officials were permitted ownership of two such establishments each, and these were guaranteed against raiding.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="235" />Two of the most prominent houses were known as Jack's House. There were not more than a dozen such personally owned political bawdy houses in town, but they had the cream of the business, because of their notorious protection. There were scores of less safe places, but all were reasonably safe, since all paid protection money to a precinct boss, a police captain or lieutenant, or to some other officer of the law, who, in turn, whacked up with bosses above, all the way to The Boss. Only when the hush money failed to come in on time was there a monitory raid, and that was always tipped off so that customers might make a discreet retreat.</p>
        <p>I was beginning to learn something about Democratic Government in a Big City.</p>
        <p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXVIII">
        <p>I lived with Van, sleeping with him in a small room in a rather unaristocratic rooming house area, during my first two weeks as a reporter in Omaha. I was looking for a furnished room of my own, and this preliminary arrangement was strictly temporary.</p>
        <p>Van was absent until late at night, usually. He was a member of the Eagles, a lodge which, he said, was important from a local political angle. His late hours generally had to do with the business of the lodge or some political matter, he explained.</p>
        <p>One night Van told me that on the next evening he was going to fight the Big Swede for a purse of fifty dollars. I asked something about the identity of the Big Swede, but Van was vague. He guessed his name was Swanson. He thought he was pretty good with his fists, but Van would show him.</p>
        <p>Van had developed a fondness for fighting. He was good at knocking people down, and did so upon slight provocation. His none had been broken once, and not expertly repaired. But he had a great capacity for taking punishment, as well as for giving it.</p>
        <p>The night of the bout, Van came in toward morning, in a semiconscious condition. The Big Swede had won the purse, he said, but he was in bad shape also. Van admitted that he was severely mauled, and that he hurt all over. He climbed into bed, stayed there all the next day, and never complained or asked for sympathy or solace. And he had counted on that fifty dollars to help him start a modest home for the White Rabbit and himself.</p>
        <p>I could not quite understand this way of life, and was happy indeed when a friend of Van's rented to me a room in his house, on Dodge street, back of the central high school.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="237" />I owned an Oliver typewriter, which I had bought second-hand. I used it for many years, was unable to wear it out or break it, and I finally lost it, many years later, by the only sure method-lending it to a relative. The generation that was reared on the Oliver Visibles is still full of loyal praise for that durable machine.</p>
        <p>Every day I typed a letter to Mother, and at frequent intervals to Marie and other members of the family.</p>
        <p>On Easter Monday afternoon, 1913, which fell unusually early that year, March 23, I was writing a long letter to Mother. I was explaining that I was extremely sleepy, not having slept more than two hours on the previous night. But as soon as this letter should be finished, I would go to dinner and then to bed and sleep for many hours.</p>
        <p>As I wrote, the room became dark. I turned on the light. I was conscious of an approaching storm. I noted it in the letter, and predicted that rain might prevent me from going out to dinner at the Mandarin, a treat I had been promising myself for three weeks.</p>
        <p>Presently a roaring sound blanked everything else, and the lights went dark. Looking out the closed window, I saw the most destructive tornado in history, up to
        <pb n="238" />that time, tearing across the city, apparently aiming for nothing but this frail old rooming house.</p>
        <p>Along with the other inhabitants who could move, I made for the street, there being no "cyclone cellars," such as all sensible farmers in Kansas maintained for such emergencies.</p>
        <p>When we reached the street, the only light was that of a score of fires, in the wake of the storm. The twisting cloud had passed us by, and was now visible, lightning darting from its top and sides, in a wrathful progress across the city.</p>
        <p>A tornado, I should explain for those who do not come from tornado country, is a concentrated dose of wind, lightning, hail and rain, with unspecified items added, roving forward, in the northern hemisphere, from southwest to northeast, at a rate usually constant at a mile a minute. The speed of the whirling wind within the storm has never been measured, because it will eat up any measuring instruments you offer to it. The house in which I lived was several blocks from the path of the storm. The path is always clear and sharp, and in this case was from four to six blocks wide.</p>
        <p>I started walking toward lights, and, in two or three blocks, came upon the stylish undertaking establishment of a young man named Leo Hoffman. I had met him at morgues and funerals. He had one of the first monumental-front undertaking houses in Omaha. It was handsome.</p>
        <p>I found Leo at his desk, billing the customers.</p>
        <p>"Come on, Leo!" I shouted. "You're getting the break of your life! Get on the job, and I'll go with you!" "What's the matter, Charlie, another murder?""Good God, man, God Almighty is making corpses for you by the thousands, and you sit here haggling over a pewtar [sic] handle that pulled off the coffin of a bartender? A tornado is wiping up the torn, and you'd better got to your body-snatching!"Leo walked outside with me. The air was calm and sultry, there at the shop.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="239" />Lurid lights were mopping up the dark clouds, as gas mains burst and trolley lines fell into the wreckage. A fire company was dashing by, lights on.</p>
        <p>Leo ran back to call police for information.</p>
        <p>"By God, the phones are out!" he panted.</p>
        <p>"Damn right, and you'll be out too if you don't start one of trucks and come with me!"Leo ordered out every piece of rolling stock. As we began to move the lights went out in our section, too. Trolley cars were dead in their tracks, a mile from the storm scene.</p>
        <p>Leo managed to get six or eight trucks, hearses and utility vehicles into the battle during the night, but on our first trip the "dead wagon" was manned by a driver, one worker, Leo and me. As we approached the line of towering fires, through total darkness, we met little bands of refugees, some carrying injured members of their families. We had to reduce speed to a crawl, because of wires that had fallen into the street.</p>
        <p>When we reached the sharply-defined zone of devastation, we had to stop, park the car, and plunge ahead on foot. Leo had flashlights for all of us, rolls of bandages, some emergency medicines, but no doctor or nurse.</p>
        <p>We made first for a burning bit of wreckage that had been a dwelling. Members of the household, unspeakably battered, torn, and bloody, begged us to rescue Minnie, who was buried under the burning wreckage, and was about to have a baby.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, rain had begun to fall in cold torrents. It was dampening the fires that the firemen were powerless to battle, since all fireplugs had been buried under tons of debris, and most had been broken off at pavement level. We got one Negro to help, and went for Minnie.</p>
        <p>After removing furniture, walls, and a neighbor's barn from the bed, which had merely collapsed sufficiently to save Minnie, we lifted the heavy woman off the mattress and carried her through streets chin-high with wreckage, to the dead wagon.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="240" />A uniformed policeman, standing by the truck, joined us, and the driver made his way as fast as he could to the nearest hospital.</p>
        <p>Poor Leo was destined to make not a dollar out of that initial trip, though he did well for himself in the hours and weeks that followed. Instead of a corpse, for Leo to bury, we delivered at the hospital Minnie and her new baby, who was promptly named Easter by acclamation, since it was evening Angelus on Easter Sunday when she was born in the dead wagon, the cop performing most of the labor. The mother didn't know whether she was alive or in heaven.</p>
        <p>Leo stopped long enough, on the return trip, to order more trucks, drivers, workers. Fire and police departments were swinging into the show, with wrecking crews from neighboring towns beginning to arrive by truck. A regiment of infantry, with engineering and medical units attached, was moving in from Fort Omaha, and the area was surrounded by armed guards before daylight.</p>
        <p>As long as I worked with Leo's crew, I was helpful in removing bodies and pulling them into trucks, but I wasn't getting much definite news for my paper, since dead women, as well as men, tell no remarkable tales for an extra edition. I had not been able to telephone, but knew that I would get to a phone eventually, and that the boys at the office would be glad to hear from me.</p>
        <p>I became separated from Leo and his men when a parted trolley cable killed a dazed man who was splashing through the water in which both ends of the cable were immersed. Soon thereafter the power was shut off at a substation, and we had no more trouble with those wicked trolley lines.</p>
        <p>I had a pocketful of notes, mostly names and addresses of dead and seriously injured, when I reached a telephone exchange building, only partly demolished, on Lake street, about eleven o'clock that night. The roof of the building was gone, all the windows were out, doors were lacking, and wreckage blocked the stairs. But telephone engineers already had rigged an emergency lighting plant, and operators, soaked to the skin, many with bandaged heads and torn clothing, sat at their stations, plugging
        <pb n="241" />in emergency calls. This building was at the edge of the storm's path. It was exceptionally well constructed, so it had not been destroyed.</p>
        <p>Several lines were working, and the engineering crews were linking up more every hour. Here, I could see, would be the center for emergency work. No booths remained. Rain had changed to snow, and the line of operators, some of whom were sobbing hysterically as they worked, was being gently whitened by the snow.</p>
        <p>A girl at the end of the line asked me what she could do for me, I told her my occupation, and said that I must get a line to my office. She got the number for me and gave me her head-set. I talked directly into the instrument used by the operator, gave all my information, was duly commended and told to stay right with it. Extras would issue all through the night, as fast as new matter came in. A dozen reporters were scattered through the storm's path. The Governor would arrive at about daylight, and I should try to report at the office at that time, get some hot coffee, which was being served there, and make the tour of the devastation with the Governor and his party.</p>
        <p>The operator had listened closely as I read names of dead and injured. As I handed back her head-set she asked whether I had heard anything of this family and that one.</p>
        <p>She lived in the area, her home had been blown away, but she had heard that her family was safe. I promised to look for the persons she named, as well as for a list of persons she had taken down from anxious callers. Then I went to work in the temporary hospital-morgue that occupied moat of the ground floor of the telephone building. Light had not yet been provided here, but I saw persons with flashlights moving about among the rows of dead and injured, laid out on the concrete floor.</p>
        <p>I got out my flashlight and note pad and started on hands and knees, going from one to another, asking for names and addresses when I found life in the patient. Doctors were at work, and ware glad to have me gat identifications, to set the minds of the unlucky people at rest.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="242" />As I crawled thus, on hands and knees, scribbling the sad toll as best I could, I met another flashlighter, also on his knees, carrying a crucifix, a rosary, and a prayer-book. We exchanged identification. He was Father Flanagan, curate at a church in the neighborhood. We would work together, as he could not spare the time to take down all the messages these people, many of them dying, wanted to send to their relatives. I told each one that I would get his message into the paper, where his family and friends would be rare to read it. ,This, I learned, was the Father Flanagan of whom Van had spoken so enthusiastically, in connection with the boys at the Detention Home. The young priest had taken several of the boys under his personal protection, had given them a temporary home, and assumed responsibility for them. He was the only clergyman of any faith I met during that long and cruel night.</p>
        <p>Once more to jump ahead of the story in order to complete this part of it: I renewed acquaintance with Father Flanagan many years later, when I flew to Omaha from New York to deliver the commencement address at Boy's Town, Nebraska.</p>
        <p>After my second telephone report to the office, I went into the streets again, and came upon one of the dumbest heroes it has been my luck to meet, though I have had to celebrate many clods as heroes, in print.</p>
        <p>A trolley car, filled with passengers, had been hit as it entered the storm area. There it stood, a grotesque wreck, partly on the tracks, partly on the pavement. One side of a building was crazily leaning upon it. The trolley pole had been twisted into an amusing pattern, and hung over one side of the car. All windows and doors were gone, the wires were down, and the inside of the car was piled high with soggy clothing, women's hand-bags, bricks and gear.</p>
        <p>The conductor, clothes in tatters, head matted with blood, soaking wet, sat on a pile of wreckage inside the car. I talked with him. He and his passengers had seen the tornado coning when the car stopped for lack of power. There was a rush for the exit. Some managed to reach a ditch that was being dug by the gas company on
        <pb n="243" />the further side of the street, and most of them were saved. But nearly all those in the car were killed or badly injured. The motorman was killed. A cleanup crew had removed the dead.</p>
        <p>Why didn't he try to go home? Wouldn't his family be worried about him?</p>
        <p>He gave me a telephone number. "I wish you'd call my wife and tell her I'm all right.""But I can get transportation for you," I said.</p>
        <p>"I gotta stay here. Here's the rule in the rule book. It says that in case of accident the conductor must stay with the car till somebody comes from the head office to release him. I been with this company fourteen years, and I ain't goin' to lose my job now."I saw him again at noon, the day after the storm, when I made the rounds with the Governor. He was still guarding the twisted mass of wreckage that had been a trolley car. He had not had anything to eat. I got him a cup of coffee from one of the relief stations and wrote him up for a hero. That writeup [sic] forced an increase of five dollars a month in his pay.</p>
        <p>When I reached the office at about seven o'clock in the morning, I found that history had been made in journalism, as well as in disaster. The News was a United Press newspaper, and suffered by comparison with newspapers holding an Associated Press franchise. But this tornado had blown the U. P. many years ahead in its development and prestige. We had the tornado story exclusive, throughout the world! We kept it exclusive for more than twelve hours. Associated Press newspapers could not get a line. They were reduced to the humiliating necessity of quoting, with permission, from U. P. papers.</p>
        <p>All telegraph lines were down as soon as the storm had passed. The telegraph operator for U. P. at the News was a long, quiet, smiling fellow, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten. The U.P. bureau manager (and manager meant the one and only U.P. reporter) was a handsome young Irishman by the name of Hal O'Flaherty.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="244" />Everybody loved Hal. He was happy, full of verve and ambition, a gay companion. But it so fell out that he was extremely drunk on that Easter Sunday evening, when the tornado plowed through Omaha. He arrived at the office some time during the night, was presently laid out on the exchange table, and slept through the hectic night without knowing whether it was a tornado or a bottle of bourbon that had hit him.</p>
        <p>Knowing the situation, the operator went to work. He succeeded in finding one wire that could be repaired quickly, establishing contact with the world. He saw to it, personally, that the wire was fixed. Then he sat at his key and sent anything that was handed to him, to retain exclusive use of that wire. Every piece of copy that was written by our reporters was piled at his elbow as fast as it was set in the News composing room. All night the operator sat at his job, keeping the wire busy. All night Hal O'Flaherty slept peacefully on the exchange table. Once the flow of news was interrupted by the State Department in Washington. William Jennings Bryan, Secretary of State, was known to be in Omaha, stopping over for the night on a westward journey. Was he safe? The query was directed to the U.P., which had the only wire. The answer was that Mr. Bryan was safe in his hotel, which was far from the path of the storm. The operator continued his sending. All that night, most of the next day. He went to sleep only after another wire had been rigged, and the A.P. began sending out-of-date news.</p>
        <p>Journalistic history was made. U.P. headquarters in New York and Chicago camethrough frequently with commendation of the noble work being done by O'Flaherty, who was dead to the world and didn't read the congratulations until late the next day. U.P. made the most of the scoop. It signed up many additional clients. This may have been the turning point that pulled U.P. out of the end.</p>
        <p>Soon after the storm, when spot news began to quiet, Hal was ordered to report, to Chicago headquarters. His trifling wage was increased to a respectable salary, and he was put into training for a notable Scripps career. His picture 
        <pb n="245" />appeared in "Hell Box," the U.P. house organ, with a thrilling story of his heroic work on the tornado and his outwitting of all opposition by his clever monopoly of the wire. U.P. newspapers printed lurid stories of this journalistic hero of the storm.</p>
        <p>In Omaha, everybody liked Hal so well that nobody breathed a word of the truth, which both the News and the opposition knew well. We all hoped Hal would be rewarded handsomely. He was. A farewell party was staged for Hal on the eve of his departure for Chicago and New York, to receive his reward for the tremendous scoop and its masterful handling. At the Rome Hotel, I was the only sober customer, because I was the only total abstainer. I had as much fun as anybody, and sometimes I think I had more. The others had forgotten most of the evening's excitement when they came to. I recall a joyous street parade, in the early morning hours, in which reporters, editors and pressmen were perched upon running boards and fenders, and all were shouting and singing. The tornado was over! Its hero was on his way to fame and fortune! We all rejoiced, for Hal was a good fellow.</p>
        <p>Since I do not go for footnotes, perhaps this is the place to add that Hal, native of What Cheer, Iowa, became one of the world's most famous and successful newspapermen. He went to the First War to End Wars as London correspondent for the U.P., transferred there to the New York Sun, then to the Chicago Daily News. Eventually, he became managing editor of that prosperous newspaper, and grew in fame and fortune as he advanced from victory unto victory. He made good in every job. But an ill wind gave him his first big push.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXIX">
        <p>Offers of aid for the badly wounded city poured in from everywhere. Our Mayor Jim Dahlman, known as the Cowboy Major, without taking trouble to learn the facts about damage and injuries, sent out a public statement to the press associations, saying Omaha declined the proffered aid, and was able to take care of herself.</p>
        <p>This caused a hurricane of protest in the city, led by the News. I wrote a poem about it, rebuking the mayor. It was published on page one, without a by-line. Next day the Mayor sent out an appeal to the country for help. It came by trainloads. The Public Auditorium was used as Relief Headquarters, beginning at once. Thousands of Omahansvolunteered for relief work, and presently social workers from the Red Cross began piling in from New York and Chicago. These were paid workers, and they bossed the volunteers about in a way that made the professionals unpopular. They set up an elaborate system of relief rolls, card-indexed until it required an expert accountant to get any significant facts about the sufferers.</p>
        <p>During the days of digging through ruins, recovering bodies, and making occasional belated rescues, some strangely pathetic cases were uncovered, as well as some that were not devoid of humor.</p>
        <p>I found a family, consisting of an aged grandmother, her daughter, and the daughter's baby, trying to resume living in their wrecked horse. They didn't want to apply for relief, because the questioning of the do-gooders would put on public record the circumstance that the baby was illigitimate [sic], and the baby's father missing.</p>
        <p>The tornado had blown roof and windows away. Grandma was pinned for hours in the wreckage, but Daughter, the baby and the coal stove
        <pb n="247" />had been carried several blocks and set down together, Daughter nicely seated upon the hot stove, where a lid had been, [sic] The baby in her arms was uninjured. Baby's mama, however, was badly burned, required present medical aid, and was unable to sit down for many days. I convinced the family that relief was essential, and got the three on the rolls, with supplies, medical help and bedding quickly delivered.</p>
        <p>Surmounting the crest of the highest hill in the path of the storm was the Monastery of St. Clare, housing a community of mendicant nuns called the Poor Clares. It was one story high, with stout brick and stone construction.</p>
        <p>The Poor Clares had been operating in Omaha since 1882, when John A. Creighton, noted Catholic philanthropist who eventually was made a Count of the Papal States and a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Leo XIII, built this monastery and gave it to them. Such institutions for nuns are usually called convents, but in the case of the Poor Clares they are always monasteries.</p>
        <p>There survived many tales and traditions concerning this monastery and the Poor Clares, destined to be multiplied many times by the disaster of the tornado. When the building was designed, it was to be three stories high. Twice, while the walls were going up, windstorms knocked them down.</p>
        <p>Said the mighty and pious donor, "It seems that God does not intend that we shall build here a tall building for His Glory and the honor of the virtuous Saint Clare of Assisi. Perchance this is a warning of some great storm that is to come, and it is for us to build the monastery low and strong and unpretentious, as becomes the principles of the Order. Then, if a great storm should come and cause suffering
        <pb n="248" />among the people, this humble monastery shall stand, that it may be a hospice for the unfortunate as well as a house of meditation and prayer."So the monastery was builded [sic] strong and fair, foundations in the solid rock, windows few and small, walls thick and well buttressed against any winds that might ever blow.</p>
        <p>The Poor Clares cane in droves, occupied their small cells in the long, low, dark building on the high hill, and never fared forth from its protective portal except to beg. It was a part of the rule that the ladies must humble themselves to the point of begging for their daily bread. They went about the town, two and two, in an old buggy and a creaking horse, stopping at homes and places of business, seeking alms. They had nothing to offer in return except their prayers. It was well known in the community that these prayers were many and long, and this wicked city could do with more than a little praying by these pure and selfless women.</p>
        <p>Among the superstitious, particularly in the immediate neighborhood of the monastery, there grew up a legend that Count Creighton had brought the Poor Clares to Omaha, and to this particular spot, to protect the city against windstorms. This grew out of the history of the building operation and the change in design of the structure.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="Then, too, the ladies certainly prayed a lot. Lights could be seen through the small windows at most ungodly hours of the night and early morning, as the nuns, according to their custom, interrupted their brief sleep to chant the praises of God, to supplicate His mercy, and to meditate upon the Mysteries of Faith" />
        <pb n="The fact was that the community did little else than meditate and pray. They were known as a contemplative order" />
        <pb n="The monastery stood directly in the path of the roaring visitation from the sky. The roof sent sailing through the air in large" />
        <pb n="249" />sections. Furniture, nuns and holy objects were scattered over a vast area and lodged in the remains of trees. Rescue parties picked up dozens of them, and the rest were evacuated from the ruins the day following the storm. All were transferred to St. Joseph's hospital, and those who were able served there throughout the following weeks or months as attendants, scrubwomen, or in whatever capacity they could be useful. Little time now for contemplation.</p>
        <p>A friend of mine was the priest who was editor of the diocesan Catholic paper. He told me that he was visiting the homeless in the neighborhood of the monastery, shortly after the storm.</p>
        <p>"And what were you doing, and what did you do, as the tornado struck?" he asked Mrs. Corrigan.</p>
        <p>"I was tendin' me chickens, Father, and when I saw this monsther rushin' at us I ran in the house and started puttin' me windows down.""You prayed, of course?""Divil a bit, Father! Sure, didn't we have the Poor Clares, up there beyant, guaranteein' us protection from storms ourself? 'Tis themselves is ruint and disgraced now, Father, if I may make so bold. The poor good Count Creighton was cheated indade an' faith!</p>
        <p>"Oh, oh, oh, oh! An' 'tis printed in the papers yisterday, for all the Protestants to read, that the Poor Clares are the only ones in town that have windstorm insurance on their house! A scandal it is before God an' His Blessed Mother!"Indeed, it was a matter of wide comment that Count Creighton, following the wind disasters while building, was induced to put on the finished structure a blanket policy against fire, lightning and tornado. This policy was common in Kansas, and was always in force on the home in which I was reared, but had never been sold in Omaha, except in this
        <pb n="250" />isolated instance.</p>
        <p>The superstitious considered this insurance as an impious fraud, as though Creighton or the nuns had known all along that the town was going to blow away, and had done no really important praying against such an emergency.</p>
        <p>__________I was assigned to Relief Headquarters. Mismanagement of funds and goods that were being donated so liberally was easily observed. The paper held its fire a long time, rather than strike a discordant note in a time of stress. Eventually the wrath of volunteer Corkers boiled over, and we printed sore stories about expense accounts of the experts, the fantastic taxi bills, neglect of deserving cares, and activities of one hospital which abused patients who were rendered destitute by the storm.</p>
        <p>I was writing to Mother every day, long letters. There was a terrible drought, with hot winds, in Kansas, and such crops as had been planted were burning up.</p>
        <p>News of the tornado had frightened [sic] Mother, but in a day or two enough wires were open to permit private telegraphing, and I relieved her fears. She was immensely proud of my part in the reporting, of a story about me, with pictures, in the Eagle, and of my letters, carrying more detail. I had put in sixty hours of work with only two hours of rest. I had enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
        <p>August on the farm began rainlessly, with record-breaking temperatures and hot winds. I learned that Mother had been having some recurrence of an old trouble which had its origin in her long sit-up vigil with me in my babyhood. Bat I had a letter which she had written while sitting up in bed, saying it was not a bad attack, and she had
        <pb n="251" />called a doctor out to the farm to make sure. She would be all right in a day or two now.</p>
        <p>That night I had one of the few dreams of my life that ever disturbed my waking hours. I was standing in the Cathedral in Wichita, Mother in her casket within reaching distance in the center aisle. The exact position of each member of the family was vividly impressed upon me. We sat, and the priest began an eloquent funeral oration. Heewas [sic] my own friend, Fattier S. J. MacCorry who had managed the dedication celebrations.</p>
        <p>This dream so depressed and affected me that I wired the family doctor in Wichita, asking for a report on Mother's condition. I had a message from him saying that Mother was not seriously ill would be as good as ever next week. But I was nervous about my work that day.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon a telegram reached me at the office. It said: "Mother very ill; come home."I took the next train, arriving in Wichita early in the morning. I bought an Eagle at the station; went rapidly through it. There was a brief account of Mother's passing the day before, August 11, 1913,She had died before I got the train out of Omaha. About noon she had become suddenly worse, and knew she was dying. John called &amp; doctor and a priest, and sent the wire to me. Other members of the family were called.</p>
        <p>Marie got a buggy and started driving at a mad gallop the sandy miles between her house and ours. The horse was good, but he couldn't take it so fast on that sweltering day. Outside one of the Stuckey houses, he fell 
        <pb n="252" />and could not rise. Two of the Stuckey boys rapidly harnessed a horse of their own and one of then drove the intervening mile and a half, also at a gallop.</p>
        <p>Marie was there before the end. Bother received Communion and was anointed for death. Then the priest asked her, as is done in such cases, whether she forgave all of her enemies, she said yes, if she had any enemies. But, she added, it was going to be hard to forgive whoever was keeping Charles away.</p>
        <p>The priest talked to her as he would to a child, explaining the distance and the mode of locomotion. She said everything was forgiven. With her hands gripping the crucifix the priest had placed in her hands she murmured the prayer, "Jesus, Mary and Joseph; into thy hands I commend my spirit." Weakly she smiled at those around the bed and said, "I wish Charles were here." She was gone, and the prayers now were for a soul departed.</p>
        <p>She was only a little past sixty-two, but her life had been hard, and she needed rest. Embolism, said the doctors, but they were guessing, as usual.</p>
        <p>She lay in the parlor when I reached home. In the same spot where her young son and daughter had lain, so many years ago.</p>
        <p>I knelt beside the casket and prayed, but did not look into it. I wanted to remember her as I knew her in life, with her gentle, careworn face lighted by a quiet smile. After nearly thirty-five years I still see her thus, with the faraway gaze that seemed partly focussed [sic] within another world.</p>
        <p>I walked to the dining room, sat down with my head upon ray arms, and wept.</p>
        <p>I felt a soft hand upon my shoulder and a soft kiss upon my cheek. Kate Balch, the same who, in my babyhood, when I was lost, had brought me home and kissed me as she restored me to my mother. She was crying, but her understanding neighborly sympathy was solace.</p>
        <p>Big Flurry heard of the death from someone who had seen it in the paper. He came out in a livery rig, in his ceremonial clothes, the same that he had worn at his wedding, even to the black hat and magnificent boots. It was his first visit 
        <pb n="253" />to the farm since he had gone away to Ireland, saying, "Ye'll find the harse in Butler's stable." That was eleven years ago.</p>
        <p>He knelt alone beside the casket, made the Sign of the Cross, and prayed silently. He rose, looked down upon the good wife with whom he had lived such stormy years. He stooped and kissed her.</p>
        <p>He walked out to the front porch and sat on a step, staring into the distance. Marie brought him a pitcher of cold water.</p>
        <p>"Thank you, Maney-gaarl," he said. He added thoughtfully, "Your mother was afine woman, Maney, but she had a sharp tongue."Marie almost lost her temper. She told the Old Man pointedly that she would listen to no word against her mother, and that he should be ashamed to voice such a criticism.</p>
        <p>The funeral was exactly, to the smallest detail, as I had dreamed it.</p>
        <p>There is no after-thinking to shape the impressions, since I told two fellow-workers at the office about the dream and told Van also, before I sent the telegram to the doctor. But it isn't acceptable evidence of any supernatural or occult phenomenon.</p>
        <p>First, I knew that Mother was ill, though I supposed the illness to be minor. In all probability I was more worried about the situation than I realized, and therefore dreamed of that which I unconsciously feared. If I had not had any intimation of her illness, the case for deathbed telepathy would appear much stronger.</p>
        <p>Secondly, a Catholic funeral is much like any other Catholic funeral. The service is the same for everybody whose funeral includes a Mass in a church.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, I asked Father MacCorry to preach the sermon, because he was ray personal friend, and I did not like the rector, Father Jules Monnier, who normally would have conducted the service.</p>
        <p>I know that Mother was thinking of me in those hours before death. But I have no means of knowing whether those thoughts influenced in any way the dream that
        <pb n="254" />vividly portrayed what actually happened a few days later. Those phenomena are beyond my comprehension, and I simply put them on the agenda for study by a better light, in the next world.</p>
        <p>The priest who administered the last sacraments to my mother, also conducted the committal service at the grave, in Calvary cemetery. He was but foolish, and I regretted that some person of dignity and priestly mien could not have been chosen for these duties. But it is a matter of faith in our church that the worthiness of the priest has nothing to do with the efficacy of the sacraments.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the committal, the priest stopped his reading from the prayer book, and, to the amazement of acolytes and kneeling friends, motioned me to his side.</p>
        <p>"I suppose you'll have to be going back to your work, Charlie?" he said.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I replied, in as low a tone as I could manage, "I'm leaving in the morning, I think.""I'm sorry, Charlie. Marcellus Murdock is a great friend of mine, and he thinks the world of you. I hoped we might take a long ride in his car with him, and we would show you the town.""Well, goodbye, Father, and thank you."He shifted the prayerbook, shook hands warmly, and I stepped back among the mourners. He continued the Latin service as if uninterrupted. I was ashamed of his gross impropriety before our friends and neighbors.</p>
        <p>However, my mother was not dependent upon the forms and whims of any priest or bishop. She was a saint in this life. I have never prayed for the salvation of her soul, since the funeral Mass. But often I have found peace and consolation in praying to her. I ask her, as I did when a child at her knee, for blessing and help. She has never failed me, nor will she in my most need.</p>
        <p>Van did not get to the funeral. Aunt Fannie came on from Erie, wearing her best silk dress, with tight corset and many black beads, and a little black beadedbonnet, tied under the chin. She had seen plenty of death in her time, and her heart
        <pb n="255" />bowed down. She said she would stay on, for the present, and keep house for Poor John, until it should be possible to settle the family affairs and dispose of the farm.</p>
        <p>It was entirely evident that the farm had gone to wrack and ruin.</p>
        <p>The windmill tower, a constant source of worry to Mother, lest it fall and kill somebody, was still standing the last time she saw it. As she lay dying, the steel wheel, which had hung awry over the peak of the wooden tower for many years, beat out its sad requiem.</p>
        <p>"Bong-bong, long-long, long-long."A wind came up from the south that night, and down crashed the forty-foot tower, wheel and all. It had nearly driven the good woman crazy during her fading years. Its mission was finished. There lay the tower, where it fell, as long as John was Lord of the Manor.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXX">
        <p>The railway trip back to Omaha was one of the most lonely of my life. I sat most of the time on the back platform, alone, unmindful of cinders and hot wind. I had been writing verse for magazines for some months, and on this trip wrote a six-stanza poem entitled "The Broken Home." It was given a full page in a magazine, with appropriate decoration.</p>
        <p>One item in the home picture had impressed me particularly. The front porch had decayed and been neglected until it was merely hanging together. The steps were rotten, as were come of the supports that held up what was left of the sagging floor.</p>
        <p>Elzy Brown and one of his brothers cane over, before the funeral, and shored up the porch and steps, so that the pallbearers might not fall through with their load.</p>
        <p>The old farm was in advanced stage of decay and ruin. I hoped that John might find some way to get rid of the acres and put an end to an intolerable situation which already had become a neighborhood scandal.</p>
        <p>I talked with Van upon my return to Omaha.</p>
        <p>"John will never get off the farm until we force him off," he said. "The farm is in his name, and Mother is dead. But I know how to fix that. I'm going to make him sell and divide up, share and share alike. He's been adding to the mortgage, instead of paying anything on it, and he hasn't paid us any rent."I poured a little cold water on this project, saying we'd have to give John time to readjust himself.</p>
        <p>Van was doing better now. His White Rabbit had moved into Omaha, given up her job at the Institution, and was keeping house for him in a two-room apartment.</p>
        <p>They had me up for dinner, and I saw that WR, as we called her for short, was a good cook, a meticulous housekeeper. She opened her own trunk and showed me all the nice things she had made for their home, when Van should become a prosperous lawyer. There were beautiful lace tablecloths and napkins, curtains, and all manner of crocheted work. Van was as proud of this fine work as he would be of an extraordinarily 
        <pb n="257" />masterful brief which he might draw up for the Court.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Margaret took on a patient for practical nursing, to add a little to the income. During her absence, Van was lonesome. He spent many evenings with some of my friends and me. The Tornado Relief Administration had become Rehabilitation. Wreckage of the storm was being cleared away, and a project, backed by big money, was under way for reconstruction of every house that had been destroyed.</p>
        <p>The volunteer force had disappeared by this time, except for the Omaha man at the top, none of whom would take money for their services, and several of whom actually worked themselves to death.</p>
        <p>One of the interesting men I met while loafing about Headquarters, looking for news and features, was a person of uncertain age, possibly not more than forty, with a sad, tortured face, a good head, and a South Carolina drawl. He introduced himself as Jimmy Owens. When I started to put him into my address book, and asked whether it was Owen or Owens, he said, "Oh, hell, Charlie, what's the difference? I just made it up lately."Jimmy did not go to saloons. Neither did I. Jimmie (he spelled the first name both ways, ie or y), explained that he was forbidden to visit any saloon or house of ill fame as long as his parole was in force, which would be several months. I didn't ask for more intimate details, but gradually, as confidences increased between us, Jimmy showed me how to blow a pete, which, if you have been reading your quota of crime stuff, you will know is a safe.</p>
        <p>You take a bar of ordinary laundry soap, like this, dampen it slightly, and draw a heavy line on the front of the safe, in such a way that it loads down and along the thin line where the door closes into the jamb, and on down to the lock. Then you pour your soup (nitro-glycerine) into the little channel thus quickly created, and the nitro, which creeps into crevices naturally, penetrates into the almost non-existent spaces and into the lock itself. This is the work of three minutes, among the skilled.</p>
        <p>You set a dynamite cap on the lock. You cover the pete with carpets if
        <pb n="258" />you're afraid of noise. Then you set off your cap with a fuse or electric connection. You can, if you have bravado, and want to show off to the other boys, set your cap, step to one side, and whack it with a sledge-hammer. Some of Jimmy's friends had lost arms or hands that way. Better be safe than serve, said Jimmie.</p>
        <p>Jimmy worked as a bookkeeper, on a small salary, for the Relief, and stayed on for Rehabilitation. Of the twenty-five hundred employes [sic], he was the last on the payroll, having served for more than a year, much of that time doing all the work of the little office that took the place of the Public Auditorium in winding up the last details of rebuilding.</p>
        <p>When he had applied for a job at Relief Headquarters, Jimmie had been asked whether he knew anything about bookkeeping, and he said yes, he had kept books. He explained to me that he had kept a couple of books, one way and another, for a long time, and that one of them was "The Lady of the Lake." But he became a good accountant, and his parole officer was fond of him. The professional do-gooders from New York and Chicago set a time limit for applications for relief. Six months from the date of the tornado, the lid would close. No more new applicants.</p>
        <p>A day or two after the limit, a young woman, probably thirty years old, appeared before the Chief Examiner of the do-gooders. That was while the offices were still in the Auditorium, and at least twenty tons of clothing and groceries were still undistributed. Also, there were some millions of dollars of contributed money, unused.</p>
        <p>The Chief Do-Gooder not only turned down the young woman's request, but scolded her in a harsh cackle for daring to ask for relief.</p>
        <p>The woman walked out, crying bitterly. Jimmy had overheard some of the conversation. He stepped out of a side door, stopped the woman on the sidewalk, and explained that he had overheard. He said, "Now, that woman has no authority to turn down your request. I'm here to take care of such cases. The chairman of Relief is a big business man, and he doesn't approve of this kind of stuff."He learned that the lady had been a public stenographer, with an office in
        <pb n="259" />
        <pb n="the Bee Building. She had made a good income, dressed well, and owned the house in which she and her mother lived. The house was blown away, the mother killed, the daughter injured, all personal belongings destroyed or lost" />Do-good, upon hearing this story, had said, "Yes, you're just another one of these people that was in the bathtub when the storm hit, so you have no clothes. Well, you'll get nothing here."The woman had never sought relief before. She was humiliated; her spirit was broken.</p>
        <p>Said Jimmy, "I'll discuss your case with the chairman tomorrow. Come in here tomorrow evening, after office hours. I'll be here. How much do you need?"She said she needed enough to buy clothes and a few supplies. About seventydollars would fix her up.</p>
        <p>"You'll get it," said Jimmy.</p>
        <p>I was in the office with Jimmy next evening. His interview lasted only a few minutes. The girl went out with seventy dollars in her pocketbook. "That's your money," explained the Samaritan. "Don't thank me for it. It was donated by railroads and banks and rich people, and these dames from New York have been holding it up."Jimmy and I talked long that night. We talked of inhumanity that fakes up a charity label. We talked, too, of Jesus, who never asked whether a leper were "deserving." Jimmy walked home with me, asking me to stop on the way at his room.</p>
        <p>There he picked up a package.</p>
        <p>"Have you got four dollars you could let me have, Charlie?" he said. I handed over the four dollars.</p>
        <p>"I gave that poor woman every cent I had," he said. "I have to take a little trip tomorrow, and the fare out there is four dollars.""You'll need return fareï¿½" I began.</p>
        <p>"Don't worry about the return fare. I'll be back Monday, anyway. But if any
        <pb n="260" />play should come up, cops or anything, I want you to destroy these papers."Jimmie was back late Monday. He picked up his package at my room. That evening he was host at a steak dinner at the Mandarin. Guests included Van, Bozell,and Carl Kraus, a young Jew who had quit high school to take a clerical job with Tornado Relief. Kraus knew that Jimmie had taken a trip. He carried a newspaper to the dinner table and remarked, "Wasn't that a slick Sunday bank robbery out at Beatrice? They got away with $25,000, and nobody even heard the explosion when they blew the vault!"Jimmy looked modestly into his coffee cup, but the smile of an artist, proud of his work, shone round him, as he replied, "Yes, those boys knew their business, all right."Next day Owens asked me to accompany him to a department store for the purchase of much-needed clothing. He had been wearing the same shabby gray suit since I had met him, and his shoes were about gone.</p>
        <p>Autumn chill was in the air. Jimmie spied a newsboy with running nose at the curb, in front of the department store. He bought all of the boy's papers, dumped them into a trash can, and said, "Come into this store with me, son, and I'll buy you a pair of mittens. My uncle just left me some money and I want to spend it."The boy came along. Jimmy said to the floor-walker, "My son and I want a couple of new outfits. Will you see that he gets fitted out with warm mittens, a winter cap, shoes, underclothes, and a nice, substantial suit of real wool? Stockings, too, while you're about it. Just bring the bill tome. I'm going to get a suit and a pair of shoes. James Owen, and I'll pay cash."I sat with James while he tried on shoes. When he bought a pair he paid the clerk, said he'd attend to putting the new shoes on and directed that the old ones be disposed of. Then he took a jack-knife from his pocket and carefully cut the trade labels out of the linings. I noted this silently.</p>
        <p>He bought a new suit, discarding the well-worn one. Again, upon taking possession, 
        <pb n="261" />he removed labels and trade marks before putting on the suit. He saw that I watched this action with curiosity.</p>
        <p>"No use havin' labels and trade-marks on your clothes. If I should get killed in a tornado or something, I don't want anybody to go to the trouble of identifyin' me."We had frequent chile con carne parties at night in the office at 313 South Fifteenth street that had been set aside for Jimmy. Van made excellent chile. There was a gas plate, and Kraus and I bought a kettle, and other supplies. Kraus brought some dishes from his father's little general store in South Omaha. Billy Dye, my old chile friend in Wichita, sent us all the chile mixture we could use.</p>
        <p>There was beer for those who wanted it, but I still took my chile with water on the side.</p>
        <p>Since I seldom went out with girls, I had most of the evenings on my hands, and Jimmy's office was a convenient place to meet. I spent many evenings alone with him there. We talked of the world and its strange inhabitants. My misanthropic and Socialistic tendencies were fully approved by the sad-faced young man. Jimmie declared that the world and society owed him a living, and that he was working at an uninteresting job just now as a sort of interlude between the more pleasurable enterprises connected with collecting what society owed him.</p>
        <p>He assured me that bank robbery was a clean and exciting occupation. You risked your life, limb and freedom, but you collected big rewards. Nobody suffered any loss or inconvenience, since all money in the vault was insured, and the insurance premium was paid by the bank's customers whether the bank ever should be robbed or not. Jimmy said that he conscientiously sent one-half of any loot that came to him to the springer. A springer is a lawyer who springs convicts; which is to say, gets them out of the stir, or penitentiary. Every ex -convict has friends inside the walls whom he wants released. The springer is retained upon a guaranteed annual retainer,
        <pb n="262" />plus such share of any good strike as the boys think fit to give him. The boys are not stingy. No matter what it costs, the springer's service is worth it.</p>
        <p>It was explained to me that the springer not only goes to court for the boys inside who are designated by the boys outside, taking care of their appeals for pardon or parole, fights their cases in higher courts; he also, if he is right, will help organize any kind of break or escape, so far as outside help and a supply of weapons are concerned. There is a spring lawyer concerned in every major jailbreak. Most of these professional gentlemen are mysterious members of the bar, practicing in police and magistrates' courts, and causing their neighbors to wonder how a petty practitioner, with five-dollar fees, can live so high, buy minks for wife and daughters, and send his children to the most exclusive schools. As for the minks, they are not always bought at department stores. If the boys wish to show appreciation for a good spring job, they will undertake to supply the mink coats from stock packed in some passing truck.</p>
        <p>Jimmie wrote fiction for the pulp magazines. His adventure and crime stories were in demand among editors of some of the leading pulps. He was handicapped by the circumstance that he could not afford to become famous. He would use a certain pseudonym until readers would become fans, writing him letters in care of the magazine. Then the editors would ask for a biographical sketch in somewhat detailed form, a photograph, and so on. They would like to have this brilliant writer come on to Chicago or New York for personal appearances, all expenses paid.</p>
        <p>Then Jimmy would change his pen name and start building his reputation all over again. To his old editors he would have the manuscript mailed by one of his brethren from some address other than Omaha, so that there would be no suspicion. Eventually he started a little business, called Writers' Bureau. For a modest fee he would criticize manuscripts and give advice to writers. He used another alias in this business. He was conscientious in the work, and his advice was useful.</p>
        <p>He advertised in some of the writers' publications. Results were good.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="263" />A nice income was accumulating when the postoffice department decided to look into the enterprise, just to make sure that no fraud was involved. An inspector came around. As soon as he identified himself the proprietor of the Writers' Bureau said, "I'm sorry you're late, Mr. Inspector, but I started to wind up the Bureau today. I'm going on a long voyage, and just decided to dispose of the business by a postoffice order to have all mail in future returned to writers 'Address Unknown', or whatever you people prescribe. Anyway, I'm accepting no more money and doing no more work on this thing after today."The inspector gave directions for proper procedure, and departed without making inquiries he had come to make.</p>
        <p>Jimmie was sad that evening, as we sat in our booth at The Mandarin. "That's the trouble, Charlie," he said. "Any little business or professional enterprise I might build up would be doomed, because I won't go into the matter of my identity. I've got respectable folks down South. They don't know anything about the troubles I've been in.</p>
        <p>"Yes, Charlie, take my advice and beware of women. I'm where I am because of a rag and a bone and a hank of hair, and because of one tuneful, Juneful night in a Southern townï¿½we'll call it New Orleans.</p>
        <p>"I'd had a lot of advantages. I had traveled in Europe and studied at the Sorbonne. And look where I am and where I've been! You know why my eyes are so bad? Bright lights shone into them by dicks and wardens, trying to make me sing on my friends. I have awful migraine, but so would you if you'd been strung up by the thumbs in solitary for hours at a time, again and again and again. Guaranteed to give you a good headache.</p>
        <p>"Worst thing, though, is the remorse. I can't sleep at night on account of a terribly remorseful feeling that comes over me sometimes."It is impossible to put Jimmy's Southern speech into print, as he spoke it, so I've not been trying. But remorse was something like rehmaus.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="264" />"I've got nothing to be remorseful about. I've never been a killer. In fact, I never killed anybody in my life. Nobody, anyhow, except three niggahs, and nobody counts them. I've never even killed a cop, though I will before I die. My life is worth nothing to anybody. I want to make it worth something to at least one person. If I can shield a friend of mine by holding off the cops, and get killed that way, giving him time to get away, I'll feel that I haven't been just a damned no-good parasite all my life.</p>
        <p>"And I'll tell you this, Charlie. You're making a lot of enemies among the cops and politicians in this town with your muckrake stories. The cops will get you if they can. If ever I can take a rap for you, it'll be a great privilege. And if you want any of those boys bumped off, just put the finger on 'em, boy, and I'll do it for you, even if I have to walk right into Headquarters and do it."Jimmy meant every word of it.</p>
        <p>He took an occasional glass of beer with his steak or chile con carne now, for his parole had expired. But he never touched hard liquor, and he stayed away from the bawdy houses frequented by some of his friends.</p>
        <p>Unquestionably, he had communication with his companions of the underworld, but I never saw him talking with one of them, and, but for the companionship of the little group of unattached men, mostly of the newspaper world, he seemed entirely alone, and certainly lonely.</p>
        <p>I shall reach out, only slightly ahead of chronology, to finish the story of Jimmie Owens.</p>
        <p>When the Rehabilitation job was finished, all its work done and the books closed, Jimmy was restless, moody, depressed. He seemed beset by a fateful melancholy. Occasionally he accompanied me to a show. The Brandeis Theater was commodious, modern, beautiful. It got the best of the road shows, though there was a competing legitimate theater that did good business too. I seldom took a girl on the press tickets assigned me about once a week for critical reviews. I took 
        <pb n="265" />Van to Maude Adams's performance of "Peter Pan," and again to "The Garden of Allah," where Van got his eyes full of sand from the desert storm, and stalked out cursing. On both occasions Van was rather high, and talked back to the actors from our seats in the second row. He was particularly cross with Miss Adams because he considered that she was making a fool of herself. I did not take Van a third time.</p>
        <p>Jimmie did not especially enjoy the theater. He said it had no relation to life, and was an idle person's way of escaping the sad and crushing thoughts that must of necessity dominate the life of any thinking person.</p>
        <p>There were hints that my friend would soon be on his way, perhaps for great adventure, perhaps for a new life.</p>
        <p>I have before me a note, pencilled [sic] on stationery headed "Writers' Bureau. Y.M.C.A. Omaha, Nebraska." I have kept it all these years, because it is a memento of a real friendship.</p>
        <p>Monday, 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>My Dear Driscoll: I am leaving town today, and will not get to see you. I am leaving in answer to a wire just now received. I told Kraus I would be gone for a few days. I will tell you that it will probably be permanently. I sincerely trust I will meet you again, and on a new footing. I will watch the papers for your verse, and may write sometime. My acquaintance with you has been an oasis in the desert of loneliness.</p>
        <p>Forever your friend, James Owens. It was Kraus who called my attention, a few days later, to an item in a Chicago paper, concerning an attempted robbery of a pete in the office of a large laundry.</p>
        <p>Police surprised the gang while the pete was being souped. The robbers escaped through windows, running down a snow-covered street and dodging into alleys. All got away except one, who knelt in the middle of the street and held the police back with continuous gunfire. He was eventually brought down by Patrolman Mikula, and
        <pb n="266" />died in the street. Before death, however, he gave the policeman the name of James Owens. There were no identifying marks in his clothes, and no papers.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="Kraus and I watched Chicago papers daily. In about a week a follow story said that the robber killed in the street battle had been identified by fingerprints from five prisons, state and federal, in which he had served time. He was Charles Akers, middle-aged son of a prominent South Carolina family, whose whereabouts had been unknown to his people for many years. He was a well-educated man who had taken to criminal life for some reason unknown to the authorities or his family." />A few weeks later I stopped in Chicago, interviewed the policeman, who already had been awarded a hero medal for killing Jimmie. He confirmed every detail of identification.</p>
        <p>Jimmy did not kill his cop. But he did give his life for his friends. Few of us realize all of our ambitions.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXXI">
        <p>Van was not doing well in his work. When my regular reportorial run was shifted from police to courthouse, because the newspaper wanted me to get evidence against some of the county gang of crooks, I saw Van every day. He had a steady flow of cases, and achieved a remarkable record for winning. But the cases were mostly trivial, or unprofitable for some other reason. Van did not know how to charge, nor did he ever try to collect from a deadbeat. When I rebuked him for not making a client pay, he said, "The poor devil has plenty of trouble. I know how is to be dogged by creditors. I won't mention it to him again."The case upon which Van had counted for rehabilitation had gone sour. The telephone company had appealed to the Supreme Court of the state for a re-hearing on a verdict for thirty thousand dollars in damages. Granted. The court decided that
        <pb n="267" />the verdict was excessive, and besides, the company had uncovered new evidence.</p>
        <p>New evidence indeed! The company had got to the doctor who had handled the girl's illness, and had induced him to violate professional ethics so far as to testify that the patient had previous to the accident on the switchboard been afflicted with a venereal disease. Out the window went the case, together with Van's hopes for money to pay his debts. Van had borrowed from many of his friends, including some highly placed corporation lawyers who respected his ability and political acumen. He couldn't pay. He told me how he had met on Sixteenth street one day an old college friend, now a lawyer, struggling also, but slightly wore successful than Van. His friend used the ancient formula, "Pay hat thou owest!"Van replied that he was sorry, but that he simply couldn't pay, though he admitted the debt, twenty dollars.</p>
        <p>"If you don't pay me, I'll take it out of your hide!" said the old classmate.</p>
        <p>"Well, I don't blame you. Why don't you do it now?"
        <pb n="Whereupon his old friend, with a well-curved swing to the jaw, laid Van flat on the broad sidewalk, amid the rushing crowds of Christmas shoppers" />Van never held a grudge against his creditor friend. He always spoke highly of him, and not infrequently sent him a client whose case, for ethical reasons, Van could not handle.</p>
        <p>One day I was walking with Van when we met one of his college friends, nowpracticing. There were introductions. The friend said he had taken the Keeley Cure a few months previously, and was now on the wagon, making money, and happy. "You ought to take it, Driscoll; it would do you a world of good," said the friend, in a kindly way.</p>
        <p>Van phoo-phooed the idea that he needed any such ministration, and we walked on. But I was being forced to realization of the fact that my brilliant brother was being beaten down by booze.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="268" />Van borrowed money of me in sums of a dime, quarter, or a dollar. In each case he got out an account book and entered the amount and date. Sometimes he showed me the account, and added it, assuring me that I would get my money some day.</p>
        <p>__________There came to the desk, as city editor, George Andrew Martin, a likable, friendly, handsome young man whose ability was recognized in half a dozen cities in which he had worked. He was of medium height, thin, nervous, with brown eyes, abundant black hair, already graying, quick but droll wit, a frequent smile, and a powerful attraction for women. He was born and reared in the not-distant town of Falls City, Nebraska, had worked as a reporter in Omaha several years ago, had been fired by the city editor of the News. George had tossed this parting shot at the city editor: "When I come back, I'll have your job!" George had made a reputation in Atlanta and in Indianapolis, where he had covered trials of our first noted labor racketeers, the &lt;unclear&gt;McNammas&lt;/unclear&gt;, charged with dynamiting.</p>
        <p>Melancholy had claimed him for her own, and made good her claim. George was a hypochondriac who might have set up in business as a specimen for psychiatric observation. He had the habit of sighing audibly, during pauses in conversation, nomatter how gay. Some noted disciple of Dr. Freud says that this habit is always the expression of mourning for a lost love.</p>
        <p>George had that grief, among others. He told me how he had loved a beautiful girl, perfection of feminine beauty and sweetness. She returned his affection, but joined a nunnery. George had taken the job in Indianapolis only because she was in a convent there, and he hoped to see her in church. He had, on a few ecstatic occasions, seen her among the black-clad servants of God, approaching the communion rail. But he had never had a chance to speak to her, nor did he receive any answer to his polite notes.</p>
        <p>George told me often that he had never had a happy day since parting with his sweetheart, and that he was convinced that he would never know peace of mind 
        <pb n="269" />again. Besides this ever-present canker of disappointed love, from which most men and women recover quickly, George had many other troubles. He worried constantly about his health. He had a sinus condition, not too severe, which he fondly imagined might be tuberculosis. He had some dental trouble, which, for a short time, caused a slight swelling on the left jaw. While the swelling was present, he developed the habit of feeling of it. This became, in time, a tic, which lasted for his lifetime. New friends would ask whether he had a toothache when they observed him thus gingerly putting his left hand to his left jaw. "No," he answered, "but I once had one, and it was terrible."While working in Indianapolis, George had written a personality sketch for the American Magazine, and the New York editor of that Crowell publication had sent, along with the check, high praise for the young man's style. From that hour, Martin was determined to become a magazine man.</p>
        <p>George did not drink much. When he had a drink or two he would tell funny stories and laugh. Tears came with the laughter. He would relapse into brooding silence, and sigh repeatedly.</p>
        <p>"Don't you feel well, Goerge?" one of the boys might ask.</p>
        <p>A long, condemning look. "Feel well? Certainly not!"As city editor, George was technically competent. Also, he kept and cherished the friendship of the reporters. But he was persona non grata with the loutish President, Editor and Publisher, Joe Polcar. This mighty individual sensed the mental and spiritual superiority of his city editor, and hated him. The hatred was returned with fine contempt.</p>
        <p>George, stewing in worry about his health, and longing for a short period for meditation during the roaring newspaper day, asked Managing Editor Paul Sisson, his immediate superior, whether, for preservation of his health, he might have half an hour, or at least half that long, every afternoon, when the paper had been put to bed, to relax his nerves by means of a walk around the block.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="270" />Sisson, whose weakness was fear of the Boss and his unwillingness or inability to accept responsibility, put this grave matter up to Polcar, who sat in magnificent seclusion in the inner sanctum.</p>
        <p>The unequivocal answer was no.</p>
        <p>From that hour forward, George cherished a burning hatred of Polcar. He cursed him with a fine literary skill before the managing editor and all the staff, and maintained toward him during the day's work the attitude of a fretful tiger obsessed with a fear that a rat may bite him when he isn't looking.</p>
        <p>At press time on a certain day, I tossed on the desk a brief story from City Hall (which I covered from time to time now), relating a factual account of a movement to change the form of city government. George rushed to the makeup corner of the composing room, waving the single piece of copy paper and calling for delay. Polcar, cigaret in hand, was standing over the last form. He didn't relish a command for delay given by his hated city editor.</p>
        <p>George slipped the half-sheet under a light, and, with pencil poised, started to write the two-line head. Already, he had slugged the news for page one. Concentrating on the head, George, without thinking of the might, power, and dignity of the junkman who was his superior, looked up at the powerful Polcar, and quickly asked, "What's a synonym for 'government'?" He couldn't get such a long word into the column, and was in a hurry. The most natural thing was to ask anybody for a short word. Of course, it is "rule," the word ordinarily used in headlines. But George was in a hurry, and he needed that word now.</p>
        <p>Polcar, whose English lacked something rather fundamental, had learned to use his gigantic size and his inferiority complex as substitutes for language.</p>
        <p>Four priceless seconds were lost while Polcar blew out smoke, tossed his cigaret over his shoulder, stared down upon his neurotic city editor. Then the giant whirled about, as he thought James Gordon Bennett might have done, and strode to his sanctum, in a terrific wrath. George found some sort of word for his l3-em 
        <pb n="271" />head, and it appeared on page one, but the many years during which he and I wereassociated never blacked out the memory of that instant, George many times requested me to do the act for guests. Every gesture of Polcar was that of the inferior man who has, by hook and crook, achieved power, at least for today.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="I was assigned to do a weekend motor tour story. These motor tours were half legitimate feature writing and half promotion. There were no good roads in those days in that vicinity. Newspapers were promoting the idea of good roads to make friends of the automobile advertisers. The motor tour reporter was supplied with a car, the name of which would be mentioned in the story, and a driver who was supposed to know the routes. Marking roads for tourists at public expense had not begun" />When the assignment was handed to me, George Martin asked the managing editor if he might go along, since air and relaxation would benefit his failing health. Sisson grudgingly consented, without consulting Big Joe Polcar. A photographer also went on the tour, on assignment.</p>
        <p>We never reached the town we were headed for, somewhere in Iowa. The car slid into a ditch in a blinding rainstorm. The chauffeur walked to the nearest telephone, called a livery stable in the nearest town. We spent the night in a country hotel, arriving late for work on Monday by train.</p>
        <p>I made out my expense account for the whole party, since I was in charge of theexpedition. I had a summons to the Presence.</p>
        <p>The Boss questioned me about each item, which included three dollars to a farmer for pulling the car out of the ditch, and five dollars for the livery rig.</p>
        <p>"Why are there three fares on the train?""The photographer, myself, and Martin.""Oh, to hell with Martin!" shouted Big Joe, flipping his cigaret clear over his head and out of the open window, a neat trick which he must have wasted much time in perfecting. He cut the Martin fare out and then okehed the account.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="272" />"Oh, to hell with Martin!" became a stock expression around the office, and many years later George used it himself, with glee, when he was disgusted with life. This was not seldom.</p>
        <p>George was so gloomy und sad that when any one of us felt depressed or lonesome or homesick, it was customary to diagnose the ailment as "the georgemartins." George was aware of this and relished the humor of the situation so much that he often said, in response to an inquiry about his health, "Oh, I guess I'm all right, only that I've got a slight attack of the georgemartins."I took George to the theater occasionally. There was a good play, "Milestones," by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblock, which had enjoyed a successful run in NewYork, and was now at the Brandeis theater. It depicted, in a forceful and fatalistic manner, the futility of life, the theme being the constant duplication of mistakes, misfortune and tragedy in generation after generation of the same family.</p>
        <p>This was exactly the wrong play for George Martin. He sighed throughout the action. As we started the long walk up the hill toward my rooming house, he had an acute attack of the georgemartins. He said, "Life is futile, and it's not funny, Charlie. I'll end mine some day, and it had just as well be now. There's a gas jet in my room, and I'm turning it on as soon as I get home."I accompanied him to his room and slept there that night, to prevent the suicide. He was quite angry with me for frustrating him in so worthy an enterprise, just when he felt up to it.</p>
        <p>Yes, George admitted, there was a girl in Falls City. He had been in love with her, and at one time had thought of asking her to marry him. But his conscience told him that he had neglected her, had not made the effort required for carrying on such a friendship. He doubted if she even remembered him. She was teaching school in or near Falls City.</p>
        <p>I was beginning to worry about George, particularly when he talked suicide.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="273" />I said, "Why don't you renew the affair with Ruth? Write to her."We were passing a Greek candy store on Sixteenth street. I lured George inside. We both liked chocolate candy, and I bought a small bag of chocolate creams, a specialty of the shop.</p>
        <p>I induced George to buy a two-pound box of chocolates and send them to Ruth. "She certainly won't be angry about it, and I'll bet she'll think fondly of you because you remember her in the distant city."As a direct result of that box of candy and the accompanying brief note, George and Ruth eventually were married.</p>
        <p>__________The news from home was more than a little disturbing. Only a few days afterMother's funeral Marie's world blew up. Ed Blood had been living in town most of the time, and was usually drunk when seen by neighbors and friends. His reason for living in town was that he had to make daily visits to produce men in the disposal of some thousands of bushels of apples which he had in storage. But his wife learned that he was living at the Jefferson hotel, near the Santa Fe tracks, reportedly with a woman of notoriously low repute.</p>
        <p>When Ed made a visit to his home in bad condition there was a quarrel, and the big farmer so far forgot himself to as to use physical violence. As soon as he had gone back to town, Marie gathered her most immediate necessaries into the buggy, bundled up her three small children, and ordered Frank Thurston, the sympathetic and dependable hired man, to drive them to town and return with the outfit. She took refuge in the home of her old friend, Nell Fahey McDermott, for a few days, while she looked for work and a place to live.</p>
        <p>She found a part of a little shack, which she made into a bright home, put the older children in school, and set out to earn a living. She had never worked outside of her home. Now she took menial jobs, whatever offered. For a long time she kept house at the Rectory for a half dozen or more priests, and, of course, was badly paid.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="274" />She worked in several grocery stores, most of the time for Tom McDermott, who underpaid and overworked her shamefully, considering the circumstance that he was one of the most pious and prosperous members of the Cathedral congregation. He also charged her full retail price for all the groceries she took home to her family.</p>
        <p>Marie sued for divorce, after long consultation with her pastor. She had the misfortune to hire as her attorney an unethical slob who was a bar-room friend of Ed Blood. The divorce was granted immediately, but Ed, upon legal advice, had put the apple crop in the hands of a brother who was willing to be a party to doing the poor woman out of her rights, and there was little left for the small children when the property settlement was made.</p>
        <p>Marie visited John and Aunt Fannie at the farm. She suggested to John that she might take her small nest egg; and put it into chickens. She had been experienced in chicken raising since girlhood. She would keep house for John and her own family. Aunt Fannie, whose one good dress and one every-day dress were wearing out, could go back to her work in Erie.</p>
        <p>John stood on the back porch with his arms folded, sucking air through his teeth and looking up at the sky.</p>
        <p>"No," he said, "chickens are no good."He then went into the back yard and stared about in four directions.</p>
        <p>"This place is 'not what it used to be," he remarked. "I'm getting hemmed in."Marie looked about at the broad acres, mile on mile. "Hemmed in?" she asked. "What hems you in here?"John was thoughtful and perturbed. "The hedge at the south end of the farm has become almost a solid wall," he said. "Steve Balch's hedge and apple orchard shut out the view. The locust trees are everywhere. One has no liberty. Chickens? No, no chickens. They defeat the purpose for which they were intended."Hours later, Marie, getting ready to take her brood back to town, saw John standing in the yard, arms folded, staring into space. Aunt Fannie was on the porch.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="275" />scolding him.</p>
        <p>"John, "Why don't you do some work?" she asked. A sensible enough question, though poor Auntie knew little about a farm.</p>
        <p>John turned patiently to the worried sister of his departed mother, and said, simply, "I am thinking about the progressive age in which we live."Marie wrote me that she had given up the chicken farm idea, upon John's stubborn refusal to have any part of it, and she added that she was afraid that John was getting a little bit peculiar.</p>
        <p>When I reported these matters to Van, he said, "John is living off the rest of the family, and has Aunt Fanny for a peon. I'll take care of him."I was beginning to fear that there might be trouble ahead. In such a respectable family, we could not tolerate lawsuits or public scandal, could we?</p>
        <p>Van chewed a cigar and grinned at me. "The trouble with this family," he said, "is that it's too damned respectable. I suppose it's up to me to remedy that. You can write, but you're a damn fool. Too bad God didn't give you some brains, along with what little talent he gave you."</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXXII">
        <p>At police headquarters I had been playing a lone hand under somewhat unfavorable circumstances. The regular police reporter for the News, a sharp but unschooled young man named Art Frenzel, was relieved of most of his police beat duties when I took over as a professional muckraker. Frenzel had tuberculosis and heavy work tired him to such an extent that he looked forward impatiently to a long leave of absence, when he was to go to Colorado to rest.</p>
        <p>In the course of my investigations, which were supposed to be aided by tips from the police-wise Frenzel, I picked up convincing evidence that our police reporter stood in so well with the cops that he was tipping off my activities and 
        <pb n="276" />investigations. The cops knew in advance every plotted move which had been discussed only around the managing editor's desk. It is not unusual, I am sorry to say, for a newspaper to be sold out by one of its police reporters. In those days (it must be so different now I) police reporters and sports editors wore the best clothes and had the most money in the bank, though their salaries were pitifully small.</p>
        <p>Omaha Daily News reporters were forbidden, according to an old Scripps rule, to "syndicate" with competing reporters. Syndicating, as then used, meant to get together with the opposition and exchange news. It is generally practiced in big cities, and in many small towns. Since I did not syndicate with the reporters representing the Bee and World-Herald, they quite naturally syndicated together and against me. As there were three afternoon papers, competition was hot as between the other two and me, but the other two stuck together. I scooped them frequently, partly because they felt so secure in their friendship with each other and with the cops that they were not alert for stories the cops might not want printed.</p>
        <p>I was properly scooped in a noon edition story of an attempt to assassinate Steve Maloney, fat, stupid, venal chief of detectives. Steve did not like me. He had refused to give me news many times, locked his office door against me, and gave everything to the other two reporters.</p>
        <p>I had come in from my morning tour of duty to write my copy, had called the desk sergeant for last-minute news before home edition time, and was on my way back to the station for afternoon stuff when I saw the big headlines, two deep, across noon editions of both the other papers.</p>
        <p>The story was that three gunmen, presumably members of a mob that was out to get The Chief because of his known hostility to all forms of crime, had fired at Maloney, who was sitting near a window, from a few yards outside the headquarters building.</p>
        <p>Dejected and forlorn, I called my office, admitted that I had been scooped on
        <pb n="277" />a big story, and went to Maloney's office to pick up a story for a late edition. There sat Steve, Ben Serkowitch of the Bee, and Ross Chamberlain of the World-Herald. They had where they wanted me. I asked for every detail. They showed me the spent bullets, and the nicks on the walls where the bullets had struck. They described how the three thugs had been pursued across the street, one of them loading his pistol as he ran.</p>
        <p>But the man had fired only three times, and his type of Colt pistol used a magazine holding ten cartridges. I asked why he should be re-loading when he must have had seven cartridges still in his pistol. Maloney was uneasy.</p>
        <p>I then examined the spent bullets. They were of various sizes, but none had been fired recently. I compared the bullets with the marks on the walls. Then I faced the Chief with the accusation that the whole story was a fake. Laughing, he confessed, thinking it no great matter. Just a story faked up by the boys.</p>
        <p>That night and all through the next day's editions, we ran a head something like this:MALONEY CONFESSES FAKING ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION!</p>
        <p>The reporters, who had fooled their editors, nearly lost their jobs. Maloney was so wild that he shut out all reporters for a week, and seriously threatened to have me killed. I carried a .25 calibre Colt pistol, either in hip pocket or in the watch pocket of my trousers. I did this partly because all police reporters carried weapons, and partly because Maloney's strong arm man were constantly threatening to beat me up. One day, as I sat in the desk sergeant's room, waiting for something to happen, a detective handed me my pistol.</p>
        <p>"Where did you get that?" I asked, amazed.</p>
        <p>"Out of your pocket, of course, you Kansas farmer! I just wanted to tell you that you'd better have the sight filed off that baby gun-barrel."
        <pb n="278" />Well, maybe these boys were too clever for me. Recently they had been causing me a lot of trouble.</p>
        <p>Maloney was really a good-natured oaf. Repeatedly, he tried to be friendly and get me to give up crusading, which was proving embarrassing to the police department. I had been writing stories of suppressed news, of the third degree and how it was applied to prisoners who didn't follow dictates of the political gang of Tom Dennison. Maloney assured me that I'd never get anywhere that way, working was for a Jewish junkman who would never back me up in case of trouble. Better be regular.</p>
        <p>When I was shifted to City Hall for a brief period, I found that the DennisonGang was in control there, too. There was no two-gang rivalry, as in Wichita.</p>
        <p>I found Mayor Dahlman an agreeable politician, without ability, but a goodvote-getter. He was cognizant of all crooked dealing, but did not profit by it. He was a poor man, and always would be. But he was permitted the panoply of office in return for subservient obedience to Tom Dennison.</p>
        <p>The Chief of Police, however, was a mighty man. He sat in an enormous office, and, in accordance with an old gang tradition, was named Henry Dunn. Almost every cop who rose to the top was called Dunn, and all were dumb Irishmen, corrupt as gangrene and crude as an amateur gallows.</p>
        <p>I wrote a story about a victim of a street accident who lay in the snow for an hour, until Mrs. Dunn should finish shopping in the Chief's personal emergency car.</p>
        <p>The Chief took a noble attitude toward me, next day. He shouted that I had gone too far. I had sullied the fair name of his beloved wife. If I ever mentioned her name in print again he would... I must spare the reader. Police chiefs do not always use the purest of English.</p>
        <p>I said, "All right. Chief, I can hear you plainly. I'll have a follow story, mentioning your wife, this afternoon."I hurried to the office, wrote the story of my encounter with the Chief, 
        <pb n="279" />together with his personal threat of violent action against me.</p>
        <p>Then I went to Joe Polcar and told him what had happened. He said, "Good work, Driocoll! Go back and tell Dunn that I'll take the responsibility for anything you write, and ask him whether he remembers what happened to his predecessor."When I repeated in the City Room what the boss had said, there was a loud guffaw and Fred Carey, political reporter, said it was the first time Polcar had ever shown a sense of humor. Remind Dunn of what had happened to his predecessor! That was a good one. After an unpleasant journalistic incident, Polcar had gone to City Hall and hit the Chief so hard that he fell and cracked his skull, dying presently. Rugged journalism indeed, I pondered.</p>
        <p>I entered the gigantic Chief's office next day, none too secure in my mind.</p>
        <p>"Get out before I..." Again, I spare the pure-minded reader.</p>
        <p>I took a comfortable seat.</p>
        <p>"I have a personal message for you from my boss, Joe Polcar," I said. I crossed my legs idly and repeated Joe's message. Dunn, calmed immediately. He was a big man, but that junkman who ran the News was bigger and tougher. Dunn never ordered me out of his office again, even when I asked him how many disorderly houses he knew about. I knew the answer.</p>
        <p>The movement for a new form of government, to give the crooks a more powerful hand in direction of things, had taken the form of a charter commission, entirely controlled by the gang. As secretary of the commission a third-rate political hack called Dan Hogan, who held the job of city clerk, was given an office and a stenographer. As a reporter of city political affairs, I visited this office occasionally. I liked the stenographer, who may even have rated the title of secretary. She was pretty and pleasantly conversational. I was just working up to an invitation to see a play with me when Dan came in, on an afternoon when he had spent too much time at the gang bar, across from the Courthouse.</p>
        <p>Dan interrupted the pleasant conversation with a curt order for me to get out
        <pb n="280" />of his office. This I did, after protesting that I had a right to visit a source of news about the charter, for which the taxpayers were paying. I also warned Hogan that I would report the incident in detail in the News.</p>
        <p>I could tell by the look on Hogan's flushed face that he was not acting politically at this point, he just didn't like to see me on such happy terns with that good-looking girl.</p>
        <p>I wrote the story, exactly as it happened. That same afternoon the Bee came out with a short story on page one, giving a lying; and libelous [sic] account of the incident. It said that I had been kicked out by Hogan when he came upon me going through the secret files of his office.</p>
        <p>I went back to the City Room, and, without consulting anybody, wrote a belly-crawl retraction for the Bee, exactly the same length as the original lie, and wrote the same size and style head for it. Then I went to the Bee building and walked directly into the office of Victor Rosewater, who was, under Tom Dennison, nominal head of the institution.</p>
        <p>Victor Rosewator was a little man who, with a brother or two, had inherited a powerful and rich newspaper from all immigrant father, and had run it in the ground in a few years. The Bee was now the organ of the Dennison gang, and printed the most absurd items imaginable. The man who wrote this item about the Dan Hogan incident told me that he personally had to submit it to Dannison's office at the Budweiser before it was sent to press.</p>
        <p>I handed Rosewater the sheet of copy paper, shook my fist in his face, while he grinned foolishly, and ordered him to print it on page one in all editions tomorrow, without changing a word. I reminded him that my brother was a lawyer who had beaten him in another damage suit recently, and had already drawn up a petition for damages in this case. I called the poor fathead all the vile names that came to my mind, and warned him not to attempt to rise from his chair while I was in the room.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="281" />Rosewater simply grinned in a pale way, and said nothing. The crawl was printed exactly as I wrote it throughout the next day.</p>
        <p>I must have been, rather truculent during those days, those days of wrath. I was not a good fighter with fists, and could not shoot straight with my short-barrelled [sic] Colt. But I offered physical combat where angels might easily have feared to act as seconds.</p>
        <p>On the day of the Rosewater incident I went to City Hall, into the long office of the city cleric, and called upon Hogan, who was seated in a swivel chair, to come out from behind his protective high counter, and get his head cracked. Hogan had been a good amateur boxer at Creighton Law School, and even now went back there to train on the running track, so as to be in good physical condition.</p>
        <p>Hogan answered my shouted epithets and challenges with a trembling, "Now, Driscoll, you'll get into trouble!"When I started over the counter after him, he got up and ran, slamming and locking doors behind me.</p>
        <p>From time to time I was shifted about, City Hall, Courthouse, Headquarters. In all these places most of the sources of news were deadly enemies of mine and of my employers.</p>
        <p>__________There was one day of most incongruous relief that had a strange aftermath. The business staff of the News had been unable to get even an inch of advertising from Kilpatrick's, a large department store that advertised liberally in the other papers. No reason ever was given, but the presumption was that the conservative Kilpatricks considered the News radical, subversive, dangerous. It did protest mildly against persecution of the Wobblies.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="282" />A Kilpatrick daughter was married to one of the wealthy sons of a million dollars. The wedding, show of the season, took place at the Kuhn Memorial church, one of the stylish wedding stages of Omaha.</p>
        <p>The high council of the newspaper decided to give the wedding everything, outdo the other newspapers in famous flattery, and then face the Kilpatrick store with a request for a page ad, or oven an annual contract.</p>
        <p>The entire staff was turned loose on the wedding, and there was hardly anything else, except the weather, in the paper that day. Each reporter covered his specialty. I handled the police escorts, police protection, and the private detectives who guarded the jewels. Three photographers got every detail that could be pictured. The society and women's editors were in clover.</p>
        <p>Three pages of type and three pages of pictures! We sat back in our chairs after the press run and looked at this masterpiece of back-scratching with pride and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Next day the advertising manager went in person to the head of the big store, carrying special prints of all the photographs, and a copy of the paper, autographed by the editor and publisher himself.</p>
        <p>He was met by the chief of the Kilpatrick clan, who threatened to knock his head off. The personal staff rallied around the chief and shooed the News man out with warnings never again to darken that conservative door.</p>
        <p>"Trying to get even with us for not advertising in your dirty yellow sheet, are you? Trying to disgrace us! Get out!"Key to the absurd situation was a typographical error, right smack in the middle of page one. The society editor had written: "The church was appropriately decorated in orange blossoms and
        <pb n="283" />Upon examination of evidence, it seemed to me that the judge had exceeded his authority. Certainly, the action was irregular. I questioned the judge in his courtroom. He was on the bench, but court had been adjourned.</p>
        <p>Troup blew up in a most undignified and tyrannical canner, lecturing me and castigating me in the presence of several lawyers who were my friends. I took it calmly. No use challenging a white-haired judge to physical combat. But I made inquiries among lawyers. I had some of them examine the papers in the divorce case with me.</p>
        <p>Yes, he said, Troup had exceeded his authority and was certainly guilty of impropriety. In order to favor the rich political family and shield it from publicity, he had granted the divorce one day before the specified limitation had expired, and obviously had held court at an unusual hour to avoid reporters. I was shown the regulations, which provided the limitations.</p>
        <p>I wrote the story, and it was headlined in the noon edition. No sooner was the edition on the street than we had a call from a lawyer friend.</p>
        <p>"Your story is wrong, and maybe libelous [sic]," he said to me. "You say that Troup violated the law. Those regulations are not statute law, but regulations &lt;missing&gt;284&lt;/missing&gt;
        <pb n="285" />for the conduct of courts in this county, agreed upon and backed by the Bar Association and the District Bench."I reported to Joe Polcar. Without a word of censure, he sent me to the Daily News lawyer, an expensive white-haired gentleman named Joe Woodrough, who was destined to a brilliant career as Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I was frightened. Joe read the story, under two banner lines, and said, "Maybe we've libelled [sic]; maybe not. Technically, your story is wrong, in that you say he violated a law, while it appears that he violated only the regulations. However, you are entitled to your opinion that those regulations have the force of law. That is a law, anyway? The Law of Gravity wasn't enacted by a legislature, but it's doing pretty well. That old cuss won't sue. He can't afford to have that whole divorce matter and its handling aired in court. Just leave this to me. I'll write a clarification for the story, not a retraction, for the Home edition. You go on about your business and don't worry."Years later I felt the same way when a doctor told me I didn't have cancer. I went back to the Courthouse. Judge Troup sent word to the County Attorney'soffice that he would like to see me in the corridor. He was sitting on the balustrade, nervously rubbing his hands. "Driscoll, I want to apologize to you," he said, in an extremely embarrassed manner. "I lost my temper when you asked me some questions this morning. The questions may have been proper, but I was excited. I'm sorry that I behaved in such an ungentlemanly manner.""Oh, that's all right, Judge," I said, in wonder. "Have you seen the noon edition?""No.""Well, I was just on my way to apologize to you. There is a slight error in the edition. It will be taken care of in the home edition."I explained the nature of the error, and Troup was off on a wild outburst. He would sue at once, and demand damages, plus an abject apology. He never did.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="286" />I had one other narrow squeak with libel while doing courthouse for the News. A routine annulment petition, filed by a lawyer unknown at the Courthouse, alleged that the plaintiff had been forced by a man in Glenwood, Iowa, to marry her. He had threatened her with a gun. The name of the man was unusual.</p>
        <p>It looked good for a paragraph. I called Van's White Rabbit, then keeping house in Omaha, and asked her whether she had ever known a man by this peculiar name while she was an attendant at the state hospital in Glenwood.</p>
        <p>"Yes, indeed," she said. "He is the head physician of the hospital, and also mayor of the town."I verified first and last names, with spellings.</p>
        <p>I called Glenwood, a mere village, and got the mayor's office, which refused to talk. Hospital, same result. I talked to the telephone operator, who said she know there was only one man by that name in the town. I got everybody else who could be reached by edition time, and wrote the story, identifying the defendant.</p>
        <p>Next morning the Mayor of Glenwood, accompanied by a mild-mannered country lawyer, were in Joe Polcar's office. I was summoned.</p>
        <p>The Mayor was crying. His wife had chased him out of his home, fully crediting the story. But he knew nothing of it, had never forced anyone to marry him. He wanted damages, but, above all, he wanted a printed retraction which would be his passport to family life.</p>
        <p>I asked the Mayor and his lawyer to accompany me to the Courthouse. I obtained the petition, and when they had read it they agreed that I was not to blame. This was some sort of trick that had been cooked up against his reputation, he said.</p>
        <p>We printed a complete apology and retraction, explaining the circumstances.</p>
        <p>The happy Mayor, restored to his marital rights, did not sue.</p>
        <p>Investigation proved that a mentally incompetent young man, formerly a patient at the hospital, had used the first name that came to his mind, which was that of the head physician, when he applied for the marriage license. The girl, also not too 
        <pb n="287" />bright, had sued without learning what the fellow's real name was. So close can one come to disaster in the newspaper business, while exercising due caution.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXXIII">
        <p>The gang was becoming a bit tired of my antics and activities. It tried some mild persuasion, indirect communication through Van, with an offer to double my salary if I would just be reasonable, and threats of specific and not pretty forms of violence.</p>
        <p>News headquarters in the Courthouse was in the big anteroom of the offices of the County Board. In winter, the reporters hung their hats and overcoats here, and picked them up when leaving. A discreet young lady was receptionist in the big room.</p>
        <p>One chilly day my overcoat was stolen. All personal possessions were removed and loft on a table. The coat was new, and had cost me $40 that I could not afford to lose. It was the only one I had, and the weather was getting cold.</p>
        <p>Johnny Lynch "just happened" to meet me in a lower corridor after the theft. "I heard about you lost your coat, Charlie, and I'm awful sorry about it. I'm ashamed that any such stuff should happen in my office. I owe you the coat, and something for your inconvenience. Here, you take this and go and buy you a good coat.</p>
        <p>He tendered a roll of bills, ten fifties. I politely refused. Later, he asked me to name my own price on the new overcoat I had bought, but I declined. That dodge had not worked.</p>
        <p>All right, I would learn that Johnny Lynch and Tom Dennison are not to be fooled with!</p>
        <p>A primary election was coming on. The News had influenced the state legislature
        <pb n="288" />in the passing of a pure elections law, and the new system would have its first tryout at this primary. A News slate was running against the gang slates. An Election Commissioner, appointed by the Governor, was arranging for an election altogether different from the gang-controlled elections of former years. Election boards, instead of being composed exclusively of gangsters, were drafted from among the citizens of known integrity. Refusal to serve was a misdemeanor. Registration lists had been purged of dead men and nonresidents by months of detective work. Stuffing of ballot boxes was to be guarded against by appointment of hundreds of reputable civilians as armed guards. Harley Moorehouse, Election Commissioner, though formerly friendly with gang politicians, turned crusader for pure elections.</p>
        <p>While portentous events were seething and the corrupt gang rule of Omaha alarmed to fight for its power, the Daily News undertook a major step in the direction of clean government. Its owners secretly enlisted the interest of a small group of the richest citizens, who made liberal commitments in support of the project.</p>
        <p>Joe Polcar and his rich friends employed the Burns Detective Agency, of Chicago and Kansas City, to send operatives into Omaha and, by operation of an elaborate plot, trap the city officials in crime. That there was plenty of felony going on, nobody doubted. Just to make the sweep complete, arrangements were made to include county crooks in the net which was being cautiously prepared.</p>
        <p>So secretly was the counter-plot against the crooks carried on that not even I, who was in daily contact with the bosses of city and county and their immediate beneficiaries, knew of the employment of the Burns men.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="289" />Suddenly, when the nooses were about to be dropped around some of the crookedest necks in town, the story of the ages broke for Omaha readers. The entire Burns personnel in Omaha was arrested by city police, and machinery began clicking to put Polcar and other Good Government men into prison.</p>
        <p>Thirty-five years later I received a letter from a New York friend that explained for the first time how the 1913 reform movement in Omaha was brought to grief. The letter is from Ben Serkowich, publicity man for a motion picture company. In the days when I was muckraker for the News he was my "opposite number" on the Dee, chief organ of the gangs. Serkowich, younger than I, had been in Omaha two years before me, and was altogether in the confidence of Tom Dennison and his men and women. He collected as much evidence and gossip as possible from within the Daily News family, but not an inkling of the Burns project leaked, possibly because nobody on the News staff was any more extensively informed than I was.</p>
        <p>Says Serkowich: "Now, for the first time, you'll know why and how that enterprise came to an undignified fiasco. I guess I was mainly responsible. A pickpocket whom the cops had beaten into insensibility on mere suspicion of withholding stool pigeon information, thanked me for intervening before his ribs got kicked loose from his spine. It was in a saloon where politicos hung out. While the pickpocket was talking to me, he pointed out a chap who was quietly imbibing a beer.</p>
        <p>"'That's Frank Packard, head of the Burns Detective Agency in Kansas City,' the dip told me.</p>
        <p>It might make a good story for me if I knew what he is doing in town, but he'd never tell me if I asked him,' I said.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="290" />"The next day the dip cane to see me at the Bee office and handed over Packard's wallet. It contained a list of about 30 names, starting with the owner of my newspaper, and there were the names of all of the city and county officials whom our paper had backed, as you know. I turned it over to Col. T. W. McCullough, our managing editor, who photographed the list and ordered me to get the pocket-book back to Packard instantly.</p>
        <p>"The dip dropped it on the bathroom floor of the detective's hotel room.</p>
        <p>"Packard never suspected, and if alive today probably doesn't know that he was hoisted by a pickpocket. That list was the key that opened up your whole plot.</p>
        <p>"As you recall, the Burns detectives had two offices, complete with wire-tapping instruments, recording devices and marked money. But Tom Dennison, Omaha political boss, had something more. He had friends. In 46 hours he was getting photostat copies of all written, phones or telegraphed communications in and out of both of those decoy offices, which supposedly were agencies to sell fire-fighting apparatus and equipment to city and county officials. We had copies in the Bee office as soon as Dennison could hand them to me.</p>
        <p>"When the Omaha police arrested the Burns detectives for conspiracy to entrap honest public officials, I had all the necessary materials for a daily serial story. I recall that Raymond Burns, son of the late William Burns, was a young embryonic sleuth. He was arrested with his colleagues and was tossed with a score of filthy, insect-ridden, drunken bums, rounded up especially to keep the Burns men company. They kept them in jail, incommunicado, for days, while the Bee ran my exclusive stories of Covic Virtue Under Shameless Attack by Unscrupulous Reformers of the Daily News."
        <pb n="291" />Thanks, Mr. Serkowich. I'm sure much of this is news to many of those whose fathers and uncles were on one side or the other in the great Omaha battle for Righteousness.</p>
        <p>__________On Wednesday, July 15, 1914 occurred a triple murder, destined to shake the foul city to its foundations. Two brothers, Fred and Peter Schroeder and a friend, William Rapp, were shot to death as they sat on a culvert, between the Bucket of Blood saloon and their homes.</p>
        <p>The Schroeders were building contractors, Rapp a typewriter salesman. As I dug into the story during the days and weeks that followed, I learned that the Schroeders had just about completed a row of apartment houses, designed to be the town's most fashionable red light district. Johnny Lynch had stolen materials for the houses by the simple process of sending trucks to pick up and carry off a quota of the paving bricks piled up along certain streets where paving was in process. If any man asked questions, he was told that "the master hath need of it."One of Lynch's brothers-in-law was a jailor at the County Jail, occupying the top floors of the Courthouse. Johnny's brother, Humphrey, was county plumber, at $100 a month and no responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The jailor took prisoners from the County Jail to the site of the new bawdy house row, and, under guard of deputy sheriffs armed with rifles, forced them to excavate the basements and do other common labor. This went on for months.</p>
        <p>Humphrey Lynch took his force of county plumbers, somewhat augmented for this special job, and put in extensive plumbing which was thought most suitable for the enterprise here to be established.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="292" />The work was done by slave labor or by tax-paid labor.</p>
        <p>We jump again to the murder. The police were baffled. They threw a cordon around the block and promised an arrest within twenty-four hours. They always do these things and say them.</p>
        <p>I was assigned in charge of the story because it swelled of gang politics. One witness told me he had seen two small, swarthy men approach, on foot, the three men who were drinking beer, legs dangling over the edge of the culvert. The neighborhood was sparsely populated.</p>
        <p>One of the gangsters lit a match, passed it before the three faces. The other started shooting, point-blank, many neighbors heard a victim shout, "Don't kill me, for God's sake!" He used the name of a man well known in the Omaha underworld.</p>
        <p>In a yard staggered another of the three. Collapsing, he named both murderers.</p>
        <p>One of the men lived about twenty hours in a hospital. Johnny Lynch sent a nurse to care for him. At the coroner's inquest this nurse testified that she was an old friend of Johnny's, but she broke down and told the names of the murderers, as related to her by her patient on his deathbed.</p>
        <p>Chief Dunn refused to make arrests, though the names mentioned at the inquest were printed in the papers. Coroner Willis Crosby issued warrents [sic] for the two men and they were in jail over night. That was the only punishment ever assessed against them. Murder was safe in Omaha, as long as Tom Dennison and Johnny Lynch were your friends. I reported the Coroner's inquest, with emphasis upon sensational testimony. Also, testimony of witnesses I had dug up myself. I got affidavits from many neighbors who had witnessed construction of the
        <pb n="293" />apartment houses under guard of the Sheriff's men.</p>
        <p>One of the Schroeders, according to the testimony, was paid a low daily wage by Lynch for supervising the construction. As it was being finished and the primary election was approaching, Schroeder put the squeeze on Lynch for a little bonus, in recognition of his good work. He filed down his demand to one thousand dollars. Lynch refused. Schroeder threatened to tell the whole story to the Daily News, and that was the end for him and the two who happened to be so unfortunate as to accompany him to the Bucket of Blood that night. Humphrey Lynch had been in the Bucket, and had quarreled with the Schroeders.</p>
        <p>The case had many bizarre angles. There were seven men in the conspicuous car sent out for the killing. All seven were identified by many persons, for this thing was not done in a corner. The driver of the car was a one-armed thug, well known in the underworld. One of the passengers identified by witnesses was a certain Italian street car motorman. He and his wife were called at the Coroner's inquest. The wife testified that her husband had come home on that night in a hysterical condition, and had told her that he had had something to do with the murder of three men. She said that he had not been able to sleep since, and she feared for his reason and his job.</p>
        <p>The motorman denied everything, but admitted that he would beat the hell out of his wife as soon as he got her home. The automobile was seen to turn toward town and park at the top of a hill above the spot where the murders were committed a few minutes later. The car's lights were turned out. Two short men were seen to leave the car and walk down the hill.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="294" />The shots followed.</p>
        <p>All of this was published in the papers, the News giving the full account, with names, the Bee covering up for the murderers, and the World Herald staidly taking the middle course. Of the three, the World Herald still survives. Perhaps it doesn't pay, in journalism, to fight evil or to defend evil; but that is a conclusion which would require much more evidence to justify it.</p>
        <p>During the investigation at the scene of the bawdy house row, I was ordered off the premises, with threats of present death, by one of Johnny Lynch's relatives. I reported this to my office, which told me to go back and do it some more. I had my brother Van bring the gangster into a justice court and compel him to give bond to keep the peace. My paper did not offer to pay the court cost, fifteen dollars. Primary election day was a new experience for Omaha. Instead of blackjack gangsters who had dominated polling places in previous years, ministers and merchants, lawyers and doctors, distinguished by deputies' badges, patrolled the town with guns and clubs.</p>
        <p>I was drafted as election clerk at the polling place at which had been the most violence and crime during previous years. There was no disorder, but a disturbing incident marked the day's work. It was my job to hand the ballot to the voter. This was done within sight of all the staff and watchers. Three times during the day gangsters, easily recognized as underworld characters, asked for blank ballots, went to the booths, and returned with the ballot marked for the News slate, claiming that the ballots were thus marked when handed to them. This is known as planting fraud, and the plant was strictly on me.</p>
        <p>Result of the election was a victory for the News. Its slate was nominated, but had to face an opposition ticket nominated by the gang. Theretofore, the gang had nominated both tickets.</p>
        <p>On the day after election, results tabulated at the Election Commissioner'soffice in the Courthouse were sent to the newspaper offices by messengers, or telephoned. 
        <pb n="295" />I was talking with the County Clerk, blond, florid, Scottish Robert Smith, who didn't like me at all, when a gangster known simply as Abe Syrian, approached me and said that a lady wanted to see me at the north entrance, street level. The gangster didn't know my name, but said, "Yes, you're the one; she said the News reporter with the glasses."I was at once suspicious, but with foolish bravado, decided that I would take my chances. Walking out of the Clerk's large office, I met Van in the corridor, bound upon some legal business. I told him about the summons, and said that I had a suspicion that the gang might be trying to get me into a trap.</p>
        <p>"I'll go along," said Van. "If there's a fight, I don't want to be left out."As I descended the stairs I took my pistol out of my pocket and held it in my right hand, looking carefully ahead for any indication of a gang slugger.</p>
        <p>A little beyond the foot of the stairs I was sent sprawling by a blow back of the right ear. As I tried to swing my pistol into firing position, it was knocked from my hand and went scooting along the slick marble floor. Syrian, the gangster, picked it up, and, with safety catch off, backed Van against a wall. Van could not move, but started shouting in the sailor's voice he inherited from Big Flurry.</p>
        <p>I arose after the first fall, flailed out at my assailants, some of whom were disguised as scrubwomen, and got a running start back down the corridor. I was overpowered and beaten down, but managed to fall so that I was under the big steel mailbox, which for a few moments hindered efforts of the mob to jump on my head. However, the brutes were kicking me, jumping on my back, and beating me with clubs.</p>
        <p>Van saw little Judge Crawford, of the County Court, walking up the stairs and viewing the scene with unconcern. Crawford was strictly a henchman of Johnny Lynch and Tom Dennison.</p>
        <p>"They're killing my brother, you cowardly little bastard!" shouted Van, who had to practice in this fellow's court from time to time. "Get the police!" (Van did not know that a heavy cordon of uniformed police was patrolling all entrances 
        <pb n="296" />and exits, on Dennison's orders.)Crawford walked calmly up the stairs.</p>
        <p>But just at this time a big deputy sheriff, tolerant friend of mine, though also a gang appointee, happened to be coming by, on his way to the sheriff's office. He was perhaps the biggest and strongest man in the Courthouse, which was lucky for me. He waded into the mob of thirty or forty thugs, swinging right and left with fist and club, and, in a moment that seemed an hour, stood over me with drawn pistol, warning the mob against another move. Strangely, this savior's name escapes me.</p>
        <p>I got to my feet in a sadly battered and torn condition. I recognized Tony Calabria, slinking toward the exit. I called him by name, taunted him with not making a Rapp-Schroeder job of it, and loudly announced that I would stay and fight it out with the rascals who were the masters of these murderers.</p>
        <p>On my way to the office, which was downhill two blocks from the courthouse, I met a long line of men, each armed with a. pig of load, a club, a gun, or whatever he could pick up hurriedly. These were my friends from the office, led by the Jewish office boy. They were out for blood, having had a report of the riot by phone.</p>
        <p>When I appeared in the office I was minus one shoe, my suit was demolished almost to the point of indecency, my glasses were missing, and I was bleeding from many wounds.</p>
        <p>I sat at my typewriter and wrote the story for the home edition. A photographer took a picture of me from the rear.</p>
        <p>The rest of this story is not beautiful. The News did nothing to apprehend the criminals. Joe Polcar stood in peril of personal arrest for criminal libel with which I had not had anything to do, and was afraid to move. A judgement [sic] for twenty-five thousand dollars in libel damages hung over him. I went to the County Attorney, a cringing gang servant named George Magney, and demanded warrants. He refused to issue them, though I identified several of the gangsters.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="297" />I was in a position in which many crusading reporters have been. Personally buffeted by the newspaper's enemies, and unsupported by my chiefs. I was becoming disgusted with my job. I wrote a letter to the Cleveland Press, original and most prosperous Scripps paper, where, I had heard, wages were high, competition keen, and pace fast. My adventure with the Courthouse mob had received national notice, and I was disappointed in not getting an answer to my application.</p>
        <p>About this time my friendship with a girl served a good purpose. I took to the theater a girl who worked in the Western Union office. She said she knew something about me that I didn't know, and, under promise of secrecy, divulged her news. She had handled a telegram from Earle Martin, editor of the Cleveland Press, to Joe Polcar, and Polcar's reply. Martin asked Polcar to release Driscoll to him, at higher wages than he was now receiving. Polcar replied that he could not consent.</p>
        <p>I knew that there was an agreement among Scripps papers that no editor would hire a reporter from another Scripps paper without consent.</p>
        <p>I boiled with indignation against this unfair treatment, yet dared not divulge the knowledge of the telegrams, lest the girl be spotted, discharged, and even prosecuted under a law forbidding disclosure of confidential telegrams.</p>
        <p>After thinking it over and discussing the whole matter with Van, I went to Polcar and said, "I have made up my mind to resign."My plan was to resign immediately and wire Martin, as a free man. I was confident that I would be taken on in Cleveland. It was a metropolis, and Omaha, big and formidable as it had seemed to me a short time ago, had shrunk to the dimensions of a mean and foul-smelling cesspool of vice, political corruption, crime and dope-peddling.</p>
        <p>I had been a favored staff man since the Courthouse incident. My expense accounts were never questioned, and when I knocked my typewriter off the old sewing machine which still served as a desk, I was not reprimanded.</p>
        <p>Instead, the typewriter was replaced by a new one, and the sewing machine by 
        <pb n="298" />a new desk. It was known that I did not accept undeserved reprimands, but talked back spiritedly, even to Big Joe himself. I knew that my work was satisfactory. I had carried off the two-dollar prize for most exclusive stories every week for nearly a year, so the prize was abolished, as it amounted to an increase in salary for me. I had been given some small increases, and was now up to thirty-five dollars a week, but I knew I could make more on a bigger paper in an important city. Polcar was courteous, conciliatory, and reasonable as soon as he saw that I meant to quit.</p>
        <p>"I don't blame you, Driscoll, for wanting to get away from the kind of work you have bean doing. It is dangerous and uncomfortable, and we appreciate the fact that you are the best man we've had for this kind of work. We have been talking about transferring you to a less hazardous and more agreeable assignment.""Well," I replied, "I'm happy that you appreciate my work. It is not thepleasantest kind of occupation. Last night three shots were fired at me as I was on my way home through a dark street, and one came close. Johnny Lynch planted a whore in the room next to mine. She came into my room to borrow my typewriter, and I smelled a badger game. I wasn't sure of it, however, until by chance I met her coming out of Lynch's office this morning. I can't take a girl anywhere, because I have to walk in the middle of the street with a gun in my hand.</p>
        <p>"I like the work, but I can't afford it, financially.""What do you mean?""Well, who, do you suppose, paid for the suit, shoes, hat, glasses, and everything else, that I lost in the mob scene? Who, do you think, will pay my doctor bill? I have a bad knee and other injuries, and am going to a doctor daily.""Oh, we'll be glad to pay for any actual expenses! Just turn in an expense account.""I will do that, now that you suggest it. But I am disappointed that the offer was not made without my making complaint. It was obvious to everybody that I had 
        <pb n="299" />suffered loss in line of duty, and you or Sisson should have offered immediately to repay me for expenses involved, at the very least. Had I not mentioned it to you, no move ever would have been made, and this I do not like. So I want to ask you whether you will be good enough not to stand in my way if I apply for a job on the Cleveland Press or sons other Scripps paper.""Stand in your way? Good Lord, I want to see you get ahead, as you deserve!</p>
        <p>What do you mean?""I know that I cannot get a job on any other Scripps paper without a release from you to the other editor.""Well, if you'll stay, we'll raise your wages and give you a desk job that will be more agreeable than the work that endangers your life and makes you uncomfortable. Your knowledge of the courts, police and city affairs will be valuable to the paper. But if you want to get away from Omaha, for which nobody could blame you, I'll not only hinder you; I'll get the job for you. I don't think I have any influence in Cleveland, but I can guarantee you a job in St. Paul. I am one of the directors up there, and make a trip to St. Paul every once in a while. Briggs, the editor, already knows all about you, and has expressed interest. I'll tell him, next time I'm up there, that he may have you.""I want to get out of Omaha, but not before the recount of ballots is completed and the gang has a chance to put me in the penitentiary. They planted fraud on me at the polls and promise to bring charges. I want them to do it, just to see whether they can frame an innocent man."Big Joe smoked on and on, looking at his desk. I began to realize why men smoke. It's a grand excuse for not talking and a plausible reason for delay in making a decision. It is supposed to impress the listener or customer, but never does, except on the stage or in the movies.</p>
        <p>"You like to fight, don't you, Driscoll?" he said, looking at me with the first smile I'd ever seen on his face.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="300" />"No, I hate it," I replied. "I'm not physically strong, as you are. I suffered more keenly, while being kicked and jumped upon by the mob than any one of the crowd would have suffered in the same situation, reversed. They don't feel, so they are not afraid. I am easily hurt, so I am afraid. I don't know why I fight, crooks and gangsters, instead of settling with them for more money than you ever could pay me. I can't help it." Quite a long smoke now.</p>
        <p>"Driscoll," said Joe, "you are welcome to stay until they put you in prison if you want to. Never doubt that they can railroad an innocent man. You saw the big follow who was in here the other day, just out of the Colorado penitentiary after serving four years for a train robbery that never happened. Dennison put him there, in collaboration with the Denver gangsters. In return, somebody who is distasteful to the Denver gang will serve time or be hanged in Nebraska. That fellow came here to tell me that he was in town to kill Tom Dennison. He showed me the gun and the very cartridge he was going to use. I wished him luck. He started out of this building and got six blocks on his way to the Budweiser when he was arrested on no charge and he's still in jail. They'll probably beat him to death.""All right, I won't run away. But get me that job in St. Paul, where I'll probably freeze to death. The first of next year is time enough. The real election and the ballot inquiry will be over by that time."</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXXIV">
        <p>Herbert Quick was one of the anchors that kept me in Omaha longer than I would have wished. He was one of the greatest inspirations of that period, for me.</p>
        <p>Quick occupied a front office, often was in business conference with Polcar, walked through the city room to and from the composing room twice a day, and smilingly greeted me soon after my arrival on the job. He was editor of Farm &amp;
        <pb n="301" />
        <pb n="Fireside, published in Springfield, Ohio, and had been since 1909. He was now on leave of absence, in a complicated deal with the Scripps interests, as editor of a worthless weekly. It was difficult for me to understand how a man of his intellectual stature could devote tine and thought to editing such a sour and spiritless publication" />One of the customary enterprises of the Western Scripps papers was the publication of so-called farm weeklies. The process involved could hardly be called publication. A weekly, about to expire, was bought, or its subscription list was bought. Once a week the editor, who was also the only staff member of the farm paper, selected type from the daily paper, perhaps from four or five issues, and patched it together for the farm paper. Two or three columns of new matter was set and used on page one. This consisted of canned farm notes, perhaps one news story about farmers, and some brief comment by the editor. The paper was issued with practically no expenses, except the salary of the editor, and was printed on the daily's regular presses.</p>
        <p>This was a sorry job for Herbert Quick. But he was paid his own price. The Scripps people evidently thought that the editor of the most successful farm publication in the country was the logical person to employ as editor of the least successful farm paper. Despite limitations placed upon him, Quick, in a few months, did put the sad publication on its feet. Subscription lists of a dozen sinking farm papers were purchased. Circulation figures brought in profitable advertising. Quick's incisive writing, though occupying only a small space, caught on with farmers, who either got the paper free or paid a nominal price for it.</p>
        <p>Quick was using his spare time, which was most of his time, writing a book,"Aboard the Good Ship Earth." It was the precursor of H.G. Wells and Hcndrik Willem van Loon, though Quick wrote rings around both of them before they started to imitate him.</p>
        <p>Sundays were lonesome in my calendar, so I went to the office in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="302" />and wrote. Bozell usually was there, grinding out copy that he had not had time to produce during the week. Quick was there too, for he was a displaced person, temporarily away from his family and confined to a town which he hated.</p>
        <p>One Sunday afternoon Quick came to my desk and asked me to have dinner with him. I gladly accepted. I had more respect for him than for any of the other top men.</p>
        <p>Quick was a man you couldn't ignore. He was of large stature, tall and bulky. His head was oddly shaped, and a half size larger than large. He was almost wholly bald. The shining pate went up to a definite point, exactly between the ears. The ears were of the largest variety grown in the west, and peculiarly pinched in, as if stitched, alow and aloft. He wore rimless nose glasses, without which he could not read. He walked with a steady gait, though he had been afflicted with infantile paralysis in boyhood.</p>
        <p>Because of his early affliction, he had for several years experienced the advantage of not going to school. Confined to his home, he became a zealous student. He read everything he could find, and was fortunate in having a small town library at his disposal. While determinedly exercising and stretching his crippled legs, he did some original thinking about the interesting world that books were revealing to him. He once told me that he had never been in a college building until, as mayor of Sioux City, he delivered a commencement address.</p>
        <p>Quick was interested in everything, which, I have observed, is one of the characteristics of the really educated man. His interest in politics, good government, and economic problems led to his becoming a reform mayor, though he never cherished the idea of a political career.</p>
        <p>In Omaha, no intelligent and decent man could live, for even a few months without being shocked by the scandalous, filthy and criminal nature of the town's political setup, Quick often talked about the situation with me during the long Sunday afternoons. On the day when he first invited me to dinner, we discussed local politics and police corruption. But my host interrupted a tirade on Steve Maloney to 
        <pb n="303" />say, "You write pretty good verses, don't you, Charlie?"I was embarrassed, and doubtless showed confusion in my face and manner.</p>
        <p>"Well, I happened to be going through your wastebasket recently, and I found some stuff there that I thought you shouldn't have thrown away," said the genial Quick.</p>
        <p>I explained that I had started writing verse in school, in imitation of Walt Mason, and had published a lot of my stuff in the college paper. Further, that it had become a habit with me to sum up situations in rhyme, but that I didn't consider the material worth printing. Give me a few years and time to practice versification, and maybe I would submit something for publication.</p>
        <p>I related to my host how I had started versifying. Mother was a Walt Mason fan. Nearly everybody at this time was reading the so-called prose poems of the Emporia printer who had been rhyming for William Allen White's Gazette, and had been syndicated by George Matthew Adams, of New York, graduate of a Kansas college.</p>
        <p>It was my custom, when visiting the farm, to read Walt Mason rhymes aloud to Mother. One day I wrote a prose poem in the Mason style. It was about quack doctors, then as now one of my hobbies. I concealed my manuscript inside the pages of the morning paper, and read the verse aloud as a Mason job. Mother laughed louder and longer about that one than she had laughed at any of the much-appreciated Mason verses. When I showed her the fraud, she was amazed.</p>
        <p>But I turned out words too fast. It was so easy, and one has so many ideas that call for expression. Long before I was out of college, Mother had said, "You do that very well, but I think you ought to stop it. It might keep you from more important work. This kind of stuff is too easy for you. You must try writing that will make you sweat."Quick agreed, in part only. At least, I should make a try at the verse business in print. He told me how he had been encouraging an original sort of a chap named Nicholas Vachel Lindsay, and had printed some of his eccentric rhymes in Farm &amp; Fireside.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="304" />Lindsay, he said, would yet be recognized as an original American genius, out of the soil of the plains country. The next day, after an early consultation between Quick and Polcar, an order came through the city desk. I was to write a daily prose poem on a current subject. It was to be decoratively illustrated by one of the staff artists, and printed in the center of page one.</p>
        <p>I did this chore, along with my regular morning rewrite, every day during most of my hitch with the Omaha Daily News. There was frequent encouragement from Quick, but I was continuously resentful because this feature, attracting attention in the town, was never signed. An old Scripps policy, later reversed, was to withhold credit to the individual worker lest he become too important and ask for higher wages. Some genius in Cleveland finally discovered that you could keep the writer happy and low-paid by using his by-line, and, if worst came, give him a title. I lived to work in the by-line-and-title era, and I must say that it was fun.</p>
        <p>Morning rewrite was shared by all reporters. The city desk clipped the morning papers, using every news item that had not been covered on the previous day. These items were distributed, approximately a dozen on each reporter's desk. The reporter had to verify facts by telephone, and was held strictly responsible for authenticity. If the morning paper made an error, for instance in the spelling of a name or numbering of a house, and you repeated that error in your rewrite, you were fired. But you had little time in which to do this unwelcome chore. You had to be out on your boat, rustling news for the noon edition, which went to press at ten o'clock.</p>
        <p>In addition to the beastly rewrite, I now had the verse to do. I wrote it rapidly, since I had a natural sense of rhyming verse, and the stuff did not have to be up to classical standards. Zach Taylor, on the city desk, was hopelessly unpoetic, but devoted to office style. Twice he ruined my masterpieces by editing them to conform. That would mean changing o'er to over, and other atrocities that 
        <pb n="305" />would upset the rhyme-scheme completely. I raved at the city desk and flatly said I would write no more rhymes for editing. Zach laughed indulgently, and I had no more of that trouble.</p>
        <p>After about two years of daily verse, I refused to write any more of it. I was resentful because I had not been given a by-line on this distinctive feature, nor even any substantial increase in salary. The desk knew by this time that I was leaving the paper soon, and did not attempt to argue the point. I was selling verse to several magazines, mostly farm publications, and I saw no reason for donating the same grade of merchandise to a newspaper that showed little appreciation of my work. I was completely disgusted with Omaha.</p>
        <p>Quick understood this point of view, and quietly recommended me to several of his friends in the newspaper and magazine world.</p>
        <p>Van was attorney for the I. W. W., which today has been so far forgotten that it may need identification, particularly for young readers. The International Workers of the World foreshadowed the present Communist front. It was made up chiefly of itinerant workers, casual farm laborers, and agitators.</p>
        <p>These boys took a lot of punishment. Police of most cities, and of Omaha in particular, persecuted them. On Saturday nights and Sundays there usually was a riot in or near one of the town's small parks, where the Wobblies, as they were commonly called, assembled for speech-making, singing, and general hell-raising. They had a song, parodying two revival hymns. It went something like this: Long-haired preachers come out every nightFor to tell us what's wrong and what's right!</p>
        <p>When we ask them for something to eat,They will answer so nice and so sweet:You'll eat pie bye-and-bye, In that glorious land of the sky, Work and pray, live on hay, You'll get pie in the skyWhen it snows on the Fourth of July!</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="306" />Hallelujah! I'm a bum!</p>
        <p>Hallelujah! Bum again!</p>
        <p>Hallelujah, give us a handout To revive us again!</p>
        <p>At some time during the services a platoon of cops would descend upon the bums, swinging clubs. The loosely organized Wobblies scattered, but innocent-looking bystanders, who had not been taking part in the celebration, would hurl a few well-aimed half-bricks at the raiders, usually inflicting as much damage as their active brethren suffered.</p>
        <p>Van went to the jail after each riot, talked to his clients, swore out application for a writ of habeas corpus, and defended the bums in police court, filing an appeal and furnishing bond in case of a conviction.</p>
        <p>The question of the right peaceably to assemble and petition for redress of grievances was involved in every case. The cops were amazed and confounded by Van's high-sounding talk. On one occasion a battered and bandaged I.W.W. was led in by a policeman, and when the acne-scarred police judge asked for the charge against the prisoner, the Irish cop replied, "The Chief told us to bring 'im in, Your Honor. He was makin' sedentary speeches in the park."It was easy enough for one familiar with cop language to understand that this poor beat-pounder was trying to say that the man made incendiary or inflammatory speeches.</p>
        <p>Van gave the cop time to finish his testimony, then moved for dismissal of the charges, as there was not, to his knowledge, any offense on the part of the prisoner at bar inherent in "The Chief told us to bring ï¿½im in," neither in the accusation that the defendant had made a speech while sitting. It was legal and decorous throughout the United States, my learned brother explained to the ignorant judge, for any citizen to speak while sitting, standing, or lying on his back.</p>
        <p>The case was dismissed. The cop never knew why. f39fctï¿½ Herbert Quick was amused and annoyed by police denial of constitutional rights to the Wobblies. After a Saturday night riot which he witnessed he
        <pb n="307" />announced in the morning papers that he would speak on freedom of speech and of assembly at the same spot where the riot had occurred, on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>The park was packed with customers of every sort, and was guarded by most of the uniformed cops of the force. Quick spoke for an hour without interruption, denouncing the unconstitutional action of the police, and received a tremendous ovation. A police escort led him to his hotel. Beating of Wobblies for singing and talking waned after that night.</p>
        <p>William B. Colver, known to everybody as Bill or Skip, was another friend whom I learned to love and admire during the Omaha period. He was editorial director of the Cloverleaf League, of which our paper was a unit, one of the stockholders and directors, a Scripps man from away back, graduate of the Cleveland Press and old friend of E.W. Scripps himself.</p>
        <p>But Colver had far more brains and thinking talent than was required for a top man in the Scripps organization. Be also was more gentle and more gentlemanly than was considered in good taste in that fold. He was lame, and in youth had been knocked out by tuberculosis. By force of will, and by independent study, without reference to doctors, he cured himself, and succeeded in living to an advanced age. It was because of his limp that he was nicknamed, in hi reportorial days, Skip. He got about rapidly, by a devised combination of steps that caused him to seem to skip from spot to spot.</p>
        <p>Colver was 43 when I met him; Quick was 52. The two were close friends, and seemed to be in a plot to encourage me in my work. Colver had a way of sitting on my desk and talking, as if to an intellectual equal, though he was far out in front of me in every way. Both Quick and Colver were disciples of Henry George. They looked upon Single Tax doctrine as sound, though its objectives might be unattainable. I found myself a neophyte in the Single Tax ranks.</p>
        <p>Polcar, upon returning from a St. Paul visit, informed me that I had a job there at any time that might suit me. He said I would like Henry B.R. Briggs, 
        <pb n="308." />editor, who would take a personal interest in me and my work.</p>
        <p>Colver was glad to learn that I planned the move. He didn't like Omaha, which he visited for board meetings and consultations, but he loved St. Paul. The Omaha paper was not prospering. A $25,000 judgment in a libel suit brought by Judge Lee Estelle, of the district court, had been uphold through all the courts, and had just been settled for a sum only slightly smaller than the judgment. The paper was on a slide, and could not afford to increase salaries. Polcar's bad editorial judgment was responsible for much of the trouble, but gang control of the town and of many courts and juries had something to do with it too.</p>
        <p>I set January 1, 1915, as the date for beginning work in St. Paul, and confirmed it by correspondence with Briggs. I quit at the News one month earlier, so as to spend the Christmas season at home, get a little rest, and do some magazine writing.</p>
        <p>I was not sorry to leave Omaha. Van said he was leaving soon also, to set up permanently in Kansas City. George Martin said he was going to resign within a month, and Paul Sisson already had his resignation in. The ship had a bad list to starboard.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="XXXV">
        <p>Aunt Fannie was wearing the same clothes she had brought from Erie when she came to Mother's funeral. She was running the house, which no longer looked like home, for John. John had two a nondescript horses left, and a few rangy cattle that seemed to have no reason for existing. A dozen discouraged hogs, of uncertain ancestry, roamed about, the open spaces, seeking what they might devour.</p>
        <p>There was freedom of assembly for most of the animals, because fences were broken on all fronts, and the yards, orchards and Deep-Tangled Wildwood were inhabited by guerilla bands of the more enterprising pigs, cattle and the two horses. They ate the tender twigs off the apple trees, as high as they could reach,
        <pb n="309" />thus insuring a short apple crop.</p>
        <p>John had taken on additional sadness and had more and more retired into himself, since Mother's passing. He could not carry on a conversation with Aunt Fannie. There was nothing to talk about, and, besides, Auntie's limited knowledge of almost everything annoyed the Professor. John wouldn't give Auntie money to buy a new dress, nor railroad fare back to Erie. The old lady had lost the sight of one eye, and had dim vision in the other. She dressed in her black, beaded dress and black bonnet each Sunday, and John drove her to church behind a stumbling bay mare that was covered all over with manure. John had given up currying the horses, and long ago had ceased to clean out the stable. He explained that there was no use pitching the manure out, because the horses would only produce more. "It gets to be an eternal, endless labor," he said, sadly, "and I see no sense in it." He pointed out that it would be impossible to pitch out any more manure anyway, since it was piled up on the east side of the stable nearly to the eaves, obstructing the windows.</p>
        <p>The plank floor of the stable had long since disappeared under tons of manure, mixed with straw that was added by the armful occasionally, in lieu of cleaning. The floor thus created gradually rose by increment of excrement until the horses' backs were nearly touching the scantlings, and it was an acrobatic feat for a horse to get in or out of the stable door. Daisy and Don, the two unfortunate survivors of the horse population that, in prosperous days, had numbered thirty or more, now slept in the lee of some large apple tree which, for lack of trimming, had a screen of lower limbs trailing the ground. These trees were good as windbreaks, but not as apple producers.</p>
        <p>John still dressed neatly and meticulously as a gentleman farmer on weekdays, and wore his tailored clothes becomingly on Sundays and holydays of obligation. He was careful of his clothes, and a well-tailored suit lasted a long time.</p>
        <p>Nearly all of the land, including woods and pasture, was rented out. For
        <pb n="310" />the small farming operation that remained, John kept a hired man. He was a French Canadian, and perhaps a bit eccentric. I did not become well acquainted with him during my short visit at the farm, but John assured me that he was most amusing company. Aunt Fannie complained that John kept Jules from his farm work, just to be entertained by the man's quaint accent and idiotic remarks.</p>
        <p>Houseflies were a major, pest in summer, worse than ever before, I was told. This may have been partly due to the circumstance that all the window screens and screen doors had rusted away, curled up, or been blown far and wide by the winter blasts. They were not taken down and stored for the winter. So many careless animals, wandering about the yard and coming to the back door for an occasional sip of water, produced much well-distributed offal, which seemed to amuse the flies.</p>
        <p>I was told, and I readily believed, that in summer flies blanketed the kitchen so that the walls appeared black. They were almost black in winter, with fly-specks.</p>
        <p>One of the entertaining sayings of the Frenchman, related with gusto by John, was an outburst of protest when he sat down to a meager meal with flies swarming over everything.</p>
        <p>"More flies than grub!" cried the volatile hired hand, striking right and left at the enemy, as did his ancestors at Rochelle.</p>
        <p>I still carried a cane and limped because of the injury to my knee in the Courthouse riot. This was known as my Johnny Lynch Knee, and was to remain a not too unpleasant reminder of my robust Omaha journalistic experience for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>Marie was working, supporting her family, and holding fast to the faith. I visited at her home during my sabbatical month, and she
        <pb n="311" />brought the family to spend a day or so at the farm. I was amazed at her energy, her determination, and her ability to keep herself and three children immaculately clean and respectably clad.</p>
        <p>I visited Big Flurry at his three-room home on South Santa Fe avenue, and gave him a stylish pipe of the currently popular calabash design, because I knew he loved to smoke.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="312" />The pipe had a fantastic curve to the stem and a large white bowl. The Old man laughed at the idea, and immediately said he'd see how much he could get for it from one of his friends downtown.</p>
        <p>For the first time in my life, I asked questions of the Old Man about his birthplace, his parents, and his coming to America. He answered all questions out of a memory that was phenomenal for details, dates and names. When I left I made extensive notes of the conversation, for I had an idea, growing slowly, that some day I might write something about Big Flurry.</p>
        <p>As I rose to leave, the Old man kissed me goodbye, and, in a broken voice, said, "I suppose I'll never see you again, Charlie-bye. God go with you on the long road."I visited my old newspaper friends and the University. All had read of my exploits in Omaha, of the gang encounter, and the tornado. Some of my published poems were in circulation. I was invited to sneak in chapel, and was visibly flattered.</p>
        <p>I even called upon Liquid Eyes at her home, and took her to the theater. I realized that this might be my last chance to speak of marriage. But I was in a serious and cautious mood. The future was by no means assured. Family conditions depressed me. What if I should not make good on the new job, about which I know nothing as yet? I passed up the opportunity to speak what was on my mind, though the family went out early, leaving us alone. Of course, I did not kiss her goodnight. I know that if I did, I was lost. Though I had seen tall buildings, I was still far from being a man of the world. Though I had the beginnings of recognition as a writer, I still had never kissed a girl.</p>
        <p>__________I went to St. Paul by way of Chicago, and stopped there to plant a few seeds that might sprout, I hoped. I visited Ed Conkle, Chicago manager of the United Press, in his office. I found him a little fat man of Dutch origin, with an abnormally
        <pb n="313" />red face, jolly disposition, a tendency to chew an ungodly amount of tobacco, and a habit of shouting, without apparent provocation, "All but six!"During our agreeable conversation, Conkle assured me that he knew all about me, that Hal O'Flaherty had spoken highly of my work, and that I was cut out to be a U.P. man. About this time he was called to the wire room for some sort of brief consultation, but soon came back. As he entered the door he spat at his spittoon and cried, "All but six!" His expression did not change.</p>
        <p>As I rose to go, he said, "Charlie, we'll meet again. I'll keep in touch with you in St. Paul. New York is your meat. Good luck. All but six!"When I walked into the office of the editor-in-chief of the St. Paul Daily News I was warmly greeted by a small, neat, bald, blue-eyed gentleman, who smoked rapidly and informed me that he was Henry B.R. Briggs, and that he was mighty glad to have me on the staff. He added that he didn't know what the hell he was going to do with me, as he had no open spot and had forgotten all about having told Joe Polcar that he would take me on.</p>
        <p>Briggs asked me what I could do especially well, and I answered that I had made quite a record as a muckraker in Omaha.</p>
        <p>"We don't do any muckraking," said the smiling editor. "We get along with the crooks here reasonably well, though we don't accept brewery or whiskey ads." That's merely so we can be in the clear in political campaigns in which we may want to attack somebody who is supported by the liquor interests. We like beer and whiskey, and consume a fair quantity of it, but we don't like it in politics. Have you any other ideas?"I replied that I had one that I had tried to sell the Omaha paper. I thought it a good idea. I believed schools were an untapped mine of news and interesting features. Doings of and in the schools were never noticed by newspapers unless some scandal arose. If a newspaper should make
        <pb n="314" />an honest effort to cultivate the school administration and the principals, using interesting and constructive material and forgetting the eternal scandal angle, I believed there would be a remarkable increase in good will and readership. I pointed out that a vast majority of households had children in the schools and colleges, and the lavish use of pictures on a weekly page of school news and features would compel parents to buy the paper.</p>
        <p>"It's a good idea," said Briggs. "I don't know whether you can got into the schools hero or not. They're afraid of newspapermen. But it's our own fault. As you say, we've used no constructive stories about schools, and have played up scandals.</p>
        <p>"If you can make it go, I'll give you a cameraman and a page every Saturday. Don't be in a hurry. Go out and get yourself located, and don't come back for a week. Your pay started when you left Wichita for St. Paul. Play with your school idea, build your own page. You are the first school editor in America!"I had in my pocket a wire from Carl Kraus, who had preceded me to St. Paul, saying that he had a room for me, giving address and telephone number. I was soon located in a spacious apartment, sharing with Kraus, with separate bedrooms. My apartment mate was working as a timekeeper for a building contractor, rapidly pushing his way toward a better job. The school page started smoothly. The superintendent of schools, a German educator of the old tradition school, liked me for my interest in education, but deplored my lack of knowledge of birds. He took me at once to a book store and bought me a copy of one of his books on Minnesota birds. He told me of various woods and meadows where the different kinds of birds would be coming in as spring came on, and urged me to look for them. He had many teachers and principals who spent their holidays and week-ends spying on all manner of birds. I soon learned that the teachers who reported the most interesting material about the private life of the nuthatch were most likely to be promoted. Superintendent Lange gave free lectures, with
        <pb n="315" />slides from photographs made by himself, in schools throughout the city.</p>
        <p>I soon sized up the situation, as I went about from school to school with a photographer, meeting teachers, principals, pupils and higher executives. The city was away behind the times in primary and secondary education. Public interest in schools hardly existed. Many of the school buildings were ancient firetraps. Some large ones were of frame construction throughout. The Catholics, constituting a powerful sector of the population, maintained a system of parochial schools that was, in many ways, ahead of the public school system. The modern Cathedral school was unquestionably the best primary school in town.</p>
        <p>Here was a vicious and circular situation. The Catholics had been forced to establish an elaborate school system of their own by the inefficiency and unprogressiveness of the public system. Having put their money into their own schools, the Catholics were uninterested in the public school system, and, in the opinion of the authorities, would never vote for bonds to build new schools.</p>
        <p>Each week I published a picture of a firetrap school. An accompanying article set forth the fire hazards and unsanitary conditions. Each week a short editorial, signed by me, advocating a bond issue for new school buildings. Whenever there was a school fire anywhere in the country, the flews played it all over page one, and I moralized upon it on my own page. All of this delighted the school authorities, and every principal hastened to show me the horrors and handicaps under which his or her particular school suffered. I was welcomed in every school, and was soon the darling of the public school administration.</p>
        <p>I had never dreamed that newspaper work could be so agreeable. Nobody shooting at me, beating me up, or threatening me with imprisonment, instead, the superintendent of schools was taking me out and introducing me to his favorite and most interesting birds. Be even kept me high in the fork of a tree in a Minnesota forest for a miserable day, beginning before sunrise, while he waited for camera shots at a pair of bald eagles in a tree only a few yards away, feeding their young. He got 
        <pb n="316" />the picture, and I got a bad cold.</p>
        <p>__________The News staff reflected the personality of the chief editor, top to bottom. Genial, able Managing Editor Arthur Vance was a bald, earnest, fast moving man, approaching middle-aged bachelorhood. As in the case of my first reportorial job in Wichita, I had been employed by the chief, without knowledge or consent of the desk. Again, as in the first instance, this circumstance was never held against me. It was understood that I was a department editor with my own job to do, but that I was at the service of the desk in emergencies or when I had free time.</p>
        <p>Statehouse reporter was a tall, broadshouldered, smiling Swede named Jim Peterson. He was a hard drinker, as, indeed, were nearly all the men on the staff. Bewhiskered Gus Wallin on Saturday nights would sometimes become drunk enough to threaten reporters with physical punishment for neglected assignments. Handsome JackAhearne, who took over the managing editor's desk for the Sunday edition, got so drunk on a memorable Saturday night that he threw the story of the abdication of the Czar of Russia into the wastebasket.</p>
        <p>Briggs nearly burned up with rage and humiliation when, on Sunday morning, he found the Czar story all over page one of the Pioneer-Press, and not a word of it in the News. I overheard some of the conversation on Monday morning, when Briggs, face flaming and nostrils distended with rage, demanded an explanation from Handsome Jack.</p>
        <p>"Why, I didn't think our readers would be interested in what that damned little Czar does, away over there in Russia," explained Jack, debonairly.</p>
        <p>The humiliation of Briggs was intensified by his realization that the staff and the opposition knew that he could not fire Jack. The chief owner of the paper, Larry Ashbaugh, was a pudgy, arrogant capitalist who knew nothing about a newspaper except how to read a financial statement. His amiable wife had a brother who was a hopeless alcoholic. By mandate of Ashbaugh, who seldom interfered with management
        <pb n="317" />of the paper, Briggs was obliged to keep this amusing drunk on the payroll. His job, connected vaguely with the farm paper published weekly in the manner of the other Scripps-managed papers, did not occupy much of his time.</p>
        <p>Ahearne had somehow convinced Mrs. Ashbaugh that he alone could get her besotted brother out of jail, out of the gutter, into a hospital, or even down the stairs of the two-story News building. So a strict order had been issued by Ashbaugh that Ahearne was to be kept on the paper in an important position, so long as the drunken brother-in-law should live. As a matter of fact, known to everybody on the staff, Jack's pretensions were wholly unfounded, as any newspaperman can get any other newspaper man out of jail when the charge is mere drunkenness or "drunk and disorderly."My desk was just outside the chief's office. Beside it was a tall wire waste-basket, about the size of a whiskey barrel. The day following the Czar incident, Brother-in-Law came to work, and immediately fell into the wastebasket in a doubled-up position, head and heels close together near the rim of the basket. His hat remained precariously on his head, but he was unable to extricate himself. We were all busy, and besides, we enjoyed the humorous comments of the drunk as he quietly prepared to sleep in the wastebasket without attempting to change position.</p>
        <p>Briggs passed my desk often in the course of a day, walking swiftly, erectly, with editorial copy or orders for the desk. On this day he was nervous and impatient. As he passed the wastebasket the ludicrous drunk said, "Good morning, Mr. Briggs. Excuse me for keeping my hat on. I can't get it off."Briggs gave the poor fellow a scornful glance and passed on.</p>
        <p>Presently Ashbaugh waddled in, and as he entered the editor's office the prisoner of the wastebasket said, deferentially, "Good morning, Brother-in-Law! Don't bother to give me a hand. I'm extremely comfortable here, but I can't remove my hat because of untoward circumstances."The Big Boss bestowed one embarrassed glance, and hurried to close the editor's
        <pb n="318" />door behind him.</p>
        <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" said the voice from the wastebasket. "My own brother-in-law won't speak to me! Maybe he thinks I am not earning my pay. But I'm at work now, thinking." He fell asleep, and stayed in his compact resting place until the paper had been put to bed. Then Handsome Jack picked him up, carried him downstairs, and took him to the hotel room provided by the sister.</p>
        <p>__________A daily column, "The Hornet's Nest," had been assigned to me on the News, and I was doing a daily verse, an editorial or two daily, and some short jingles to lighten up the news. Editor Briggs appreciated this extra feature work more than I realized. One day he called me in to meet a syndicate salesman from McNaught Syndicate, New York, who had been trying to sell some features to the News, always a bad prospect because its features came almost altogether from within the Scripps organizations.</p>
        <p>The salesman was Charlie McAdam, bright, lively, personable, on-his-toes sort of salesman, who never let loose of his smile while he looked me over and exchanged polite banter, meaning nothing.</p>
        <p>It was years later that I learned that Brings, without buying any McNaught features, had been trying to sell McAdam on the idea that I had something for a big-time New York syndicate. McAdam, already a veteran salesman, was used to this approach. Not a newspaper editor in America who doesn't think he has a bright boy who could knock 'em half-dead if only he could get the New York imprint. Usually, that bright boy is the editor himself. In this case, Briggs, who was an executive, and not at all a writer, had no syndicate ambitionsï¿½except for me.</p>
        <p>McAdam was polite, affable, and gaily making a joke of everything.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="319" />What he thought of the country boy, whose editor pictured him as a promising bit of syndicate material, I never learned. For me the incident passed and was immediately forgotten. I was under the cloud of a peculiar belief that when somebody wants you, he will ring your doorbell; not you his.</p>
        <p>__________There were two men on the staff as reporters who had studied for the Catholic priesthood. One, Bernard Vaughan, who did not remain a leg man long, but was put on the copy desk because of his knowledge of almost everything, had reached the last year of seminary when rejected for the priesthood because of a physical disability. Like so many of my friends on news papers and among the fringe of the literary world, he had been afflicted with infantile paralysis in childhood, and one bad leg was a handicap to fast reporting. This was counterbalanced by one of the richest minds it has been my good fortune to meet in the newspaper field.</p>
        <p>Vaughan was a perfectionist, loathed the literary standards of the newspaper, hated all the women on the staff because of their obvious lack of any sort of training for their jobs, and had little to say to anybody. Strangely, we became friends. I respected his scholarship and honesty. For some reason, he considered me good company.</p>
        <p>The other seminary man was Bill O'Malley, handsome, red-haired, fast-talking Irishman. He drank too much, loved every pretty girl he met, and had standards of conduct that elicited only a contemptuous smarl [sic] from Vaughan.</p>
        <p>O'Malley was brilliant, but not In any sense scholarly or thorough in his work. Vance considered it a ridiculous situation,
        <pb n="320" />too good to keep to himself, that he was restrained by a garnishee order to court from paying O'Malley ï¿½s full salary, a part of which was reserved, on judgment of the court, to pay a religious supply house for a cassock, rosary, crucifix, breviary, and other priestly merchandise, purchased by ill in preparation for ordination.</p>
        <p>Bill told me that he was summarily dismissed from the seminary, two weeks before ordination, when the Reverend President caught him smuggling a girl into the seminary grounds. Bill explained that the girl was his cousin, but the Reverend President said that any man who kissed his female cousin so ardently was in no wise suited to the holy priesthood.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the Reverend President was right.</p>
        <p>__________This is the place for the recording of an incident that stands as supporting proof of the theory that the greatest of men sometimes make the most obvious and shocking mistakes, even in the fields they know best.</p>
        <p>Briggs was an atheist, holding in intellectual contempt all religion, and particularly the kind represented by the Catholic church. He did not permit his children to be taught the religious story of Christmas, and condemned the legend of Santa Claus, although he provided toys and a family celebration of the holiday.</p>
        <p>He had no prejudice against individual Catholics, hired them, associated with them, often liked and admired them. For priests and the forms of religion, however, he had no time. I lived to see him, as a tourist in Santo Domingo, going through a great old cathedral, the only man in the large company wearing his hat, even in front of the high altar.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="321" />On a certain day came news of the passing of the most notable Catholic pastor in St. Paul, the only priest in the city bearing the designation of Irremovable Rector of his parish. He bore also the rank of Monsignor, but preferred, as did his people, the simple appelation [sic] of Father. The News had been losing circulation lately to the Pioneer-Press and Dispatch. Somewhere in the higher counsels and councils the decision had been reached: "The News needs Catholic circulation, because that's the kind we haven't got much of." Here was to be the Number One opportunity to start the Catholics coming our way. We would outdo ourselves on this big funeral.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="I drew the funeral assignment and Pete Peterson was given the job of writing up the extensive obit, from the morgue, files and telephone conversations" />
        <pb n="Briggs was on the bridge when I came in with my story. It was Saturday afternoon, and we were working for the Sunday morning sheet, where the ecclesiastical funeral was to have the place of honor. Briggs told me to take the sky, but perhaps I'd better read Pete's obit first, since I hadn't known the prelate personally, and the background would be helpful" />I had read no further than the second paragraph in the obit before finding the subject referred to as Mr. I called Pete's attention to this, and he said, "Stet. Briggs's orders."Puzzled, I sought out Briggs in his sanctum. It was evident that he had taken on a goodly cargo of rum collinses at and after luncheon.</p>
        <p>"That's right," he said. "He's Mister in this paper. He may be your Father, but he's not mine. Make it Mister all the way through." "Then you will please not use my by-line on my story," I said.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="322" />"Just as you like. But we'll have no superstitious folderol in this newspaper. Mister him, Driscoll."We mistered the great prelate through six columns of pictures and text, to the great delight of Pete, also an anti-religion man, and to the consternation of everybody else.</p>
        <p>That story really cracked this overloaded back of the News. Catholics were furious. They called everybody on the paper, roaring their anger and indignation at this seemingly rude affront, and canceling their subscriptions by thousands.</p>
        <p>The paper never recovered from the wound. Religious folk are slow to forget newspaper insults. Many a once-proud metropolitan daily has gone on the rocks for less misconduct than the News had been guilty of. In its hour of need, at bay in a local political bottle, the newspaper called upon the citizens, and the citizens of this most Catholic of all important American cities, did not hear.</p>
        <p>So, eventually, ended the News. But that is somewhat later in the story.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XXXVI">
        <p>February can be a wicked time in Minnesota. Snow and bitter cold, interrupted by thaws that make deep slush in the streets and soggy mud in fields and woods. Such was my first February in St. Paul.</p>
        <p>In the loneliness of the strange town and new job, I took to my camera, photographing the natural beauty of the parks and countryside under the heavy blanket of snow. This was strenuous work, as it required breaking trail in many places, and climbing high snow banks.</p>
        <p>A thaw was raking deep slush on a certain Sunday afternoon, as I climbed the steep banks of the Mississippi to get pictures of beautiful waterfalls. I returned to my room, late, wet, chilled through. Next morning I had a sore throat. This was an ailmentI had been subject to all my life, but my doctors had repeatedly told me that I should not have my tonsils removed.</p>
        <p>During the week the sore throat developed rapidly into severe tonsilitis [sic]. One morning I could not yet out of bed. The landlady called a doctor, who said I had a high temperature, and that there were symptoms of a return of the rheumatic fever that had laid me low in boyhood. He ordered me immediately to St. Luke's hospital.</p>
        <p>The doctor was with me, soon after arrival. I heard him give the nurse orders for treatment, which included running hot water through an involved ear every two
        <pb n="324" />hours and certain other attentions every hour. That was about noon. That was the last I was of any nurse until three o'clock the next morning, and then the conditions were unusual.</p>
        <p>My temperature had been going up and up. I kept pressing the call button, but there was no response. At midnight I got up, dressed, packed my bag. Then I entertain myself with a routine. I kept my thumb on the button for a minute at a time, then off a minute.</p>
        <p>At three the nurse appeared. She was hurt and alarmed to see me sitting up.</p>
        <p>"You must get right back to bed," she said, "because your temperature is high and the doctor ordered complete rest in bad.""Yes, and the doctor ordered an ear irrigation every two hours and a lot of other things. Did I get them?""Well, this is the maternity division, and the deliveries come first. Several babies were born tonight.""Maybe so, but here's one baby who is not going to die in this joint. I'm leaving, right now.""But you can't leave now. The superintendent is in bed, and there is nobody in the office. The doors are locked.""You will unlock the doors, or I will climb out that window and go down the fire escape. As for the superintendent, she is a very bad one or I would not have been neglected as I have been. If she wants pay-as-you-leave dough, let her be on the door as I leave."I picked up my suitcase and walked to the elevator. The nurse hurried to rouse the sleeping superintendent.</p>
        <p>Said the superintendent, "I can't permit you to leave now. You are a very sick man.""That's just why I'm leaving," I said. "This is no place for a sick person.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="325" />How much do I owe you?"The woman made out a bill, receipted it, and I handed her the cash. She unlocked the door, and I walked out into a bitter cold morning, miles of snow-covered streets gleaming in the pre-dawn light.</p>
        <p>It was about four o'clock when I began walking. I didn't know where I was going or what I wanted to do. My head was thumping, and I was dizzy with fever.</p>
        <p>I wandered about the streets, in the general direction of the retail business district, stopping frequently to set down my suitcase and rest. I found an all-night drug store, where I dawdled long over a comforting glass of cold milk. At an early-open barber shop in the Lowry building, I got a shave and a haircut and told the barber that I was in no hurry.</p>
        <p>"You're sick!" the barber volunteered.</p>
        <p>"So they say."My heart vas entirely off the beam, running at a pace that shook the apron the barber had invested me with. While the scissors clipped, I dozed fitfully, and dreamed of escaping from prison amid the screams of women in adjoining cells, having babies.</p>
        <p>I remembered that in this very building were the offices of Drs. Burch, Bray &amp; Brown, who had recently refracted my vision for new glasses. The glasses would be there now. Office hours were upon the whirling world by this time. I took the elevator to the oculists' quarters, noticing by the wall directory that this was a medical office building. Perhaps I could find a doctor to paint my throat.</p>
        <p>The waiting room was full. I sat in a big chair, feeling worse by the minute. The receptionist gave me a curious look now and again, but I couldn't even see whether she was pretty or not. I was trying to figure this out when I toppled to the floor, unconscious.</p>
        <p>The two oculists, nurses and assistants were laying me out on a couch when I awoke. They said they had sent down the hall for a heart specialist. He was
        <pb n="326" />there in a few minutes, and I liked him instantly. He said I must go to a hospital immediately. I said I had just come from one, St. Luke's.</p>
        <p>"That's where I practice chiefly," he said, "and I'm sending you right back there.""Over my dead body," I said"Exactly what I was thinking. You'll be a dead body within a very few hours unless you get into bed under expert care at once."I managed a laugh.</p>
        <p>"Expert care! You should know the expert care that puts forth at St. Luke's! Isn't there some other hospital where you can strain a point and take care of me? I like your looks.""All right, go to St. Joseph's. It's just a few blocks away. I'll call an ambulance.""No ambulance. I'm not that sick, and I can't afford it.</p>
        <p>"All right, take a taxi. But don't try to walk."The doctor had given me something that quieted the heart a little. I walked to the hospital, carrying my suitcase. Meantime the doctor had phoned.</p>
        <p>The nun at the desk told me there were no accommodations available, and that the doctor had a room for me at St. Luke's.</p>
        <p>I called the doctor from a phone at the desk. He confirmed the sister's statement.</p>
        <p>"Nevertheless I wouldn't go back to that joint if I could, and I'm too sick to move. I'll lie on the floor here, or I'll sleep with the engineer or the Sister Superior, but I won't leave this place until I feel better."Further hurried consultation. I asked the Sister Superior, who now entered the case, to call my office, ask for the managing editor and tell him of my plight.</p>
        <p>He would know what to do.</p>
        <p>She did. Arthur Vance said, "Of course you will take the best care of him,
        <pb n="327" />Sister. And I reassure you that the Daily News will not forget your kindness."I relaxed in a comfortable bed, one of four in a ward reserved for the Northern Pacific railways. I insured myself to the other three patients, two of whom were heart cases and the third a Swedish switchman with stomach ulcers. Then I went to sleep.</p>
        <p>When I woke up I couldn't move. No joint would operate voluntarily. Minor exceptions were the jaws, wrists and ankles, which operated inefficiently and painfully. My temperature was high, and I didn't feel too healthy.</p>
        <p>Heavy medication began at once. Strychnine in frequent doses, aspirin in massive doses, and a few minor medications. The swollen joints were gently massaged by the prettiest nurses in the world (or so they seemed to me at that time) and, after being anointed with an unguent that smelled like a flower garden, were covered under mountains of hot water bottles, frequently renewed. An ice pack on the heart continuously. The smiling doctor, a Swede with an expensive reputation, called twice a day. I was not comfortable, but I was not worried. I soon lapsed into happy helplessness as of one who is fortunate enough to have competent and sympathetic persons all about him, looking out for his slightest wish. I only wished that I might be able to feed myself, but the nurse fed me pleasantly and kindly, turned me over when I asked for that relief, and never complained of being tired.</p>
        <p>Six weeks of this. On the whole, one of the most agreeable experiences of my life. One or two members of the newspaper staff came to see me every day. My check arrived promptly each week.</p>
        <p>I was writing a daily syndicated poem, sent out by N.E.A., a Scripps syndicate in Cleveland, under the standing head, "Ships From the Rhyme Block." The pay was miserable, but the weekly check for this easy work was an important prop.</p>
        <p>I kept the service going during my disability. Each morning when the nurse came to wake me up, before bathing me, she turned me over, took my right hand, placed
        <pb n="328" />it on a little table beside the bed, put a pencil between my thumb and two fingers, and gave me a clean sheet of paper. When she had finished with the three other men, my poem for the day was finished. The nurse stamped, sealed and mailed the envelope. The syndicate did not know that I was in hospital.</p>
        <p>I made slow progress, or none at all. One day the Sister Superior came to talk. I told her that I took on a new infection every night because of cold air from outside chilling me as I lay in sheets soaked in sweat. She called the nurse in charged and ordered that henceforth I should sleep between woolen blankets, and that those should be changed every few hours, and at least once during the night.</p>
        <p>From that day, I began steady improvement. There came a day when the doctor consented to my urging that the tonsillectomy, decreed as essential to recovery, be performed at once. I was lifted upon the table, lifted into an operating chair, and the operation went on and on, three hours. After the shock of an operation in such a weakened condition, I recovered rapidly. At the end of the sixth week I was discharged. I was loath to leave. Never had I been so tenderly and considerately treated by so many solicitous people.</p>
        <p>I was wobbly and weak, afraid of traffic, leaned heavily upon a cane and had difficulty eating restaurant food. The doctor proscribed a tonic and told me to drink wine. I bought the first bottle of alcoholic beverage I had ever purchased, a sweet port. I like it, and drank a bottle a week for two or three months. My bill from the hospital arrived by mail. Including medicine, bandages, operating room, board and care, $60. Arthur Vance had made an impression when he had talked with the Sister Superior.</p>
        <p>The newspaper steadfastly, through all the years of its existence, kept the promise Vance had made. St. Joseph's never had cause to regret its Good Samaritan care of me.</p>
        <p>I went back to work, but found the one long flight of stairs too much for me. I talked with Briggs, regretfully offering my resignation. I thanked him for having
        <pb n="329" />kept me on the payroll so long during my illness, and told him I must go back to Kansas to recuperate; that I might ask him for a job when able to carry on.</p>
        <p>Briggs indignantly refused to accept the resignation, told me to go to Kansas and stay until I was well and strong, and never to worry about my job. Under genuine protest, I accepted these conditions.</p>
        <p>On the long rail journey back home I carried two bottles of wine; one for my daily sip, and one for my Dad. I knew how well he used to like his own wine, and this was an imported Spanish port, a special treat for the Old Man.</p>
        <p>I stopped over in Omaha, saw Van and the old crowd, or what was left of it, but was unable to climb the stairs for a steak at the Mandarin. Arriving in Wichita early in the morning, I took a taxi to the humble cottage in which Marie and her three youngsters were living. When he met me at the door my fond sister could not suppress a cry of dismay. She said I looked like corpse. I said I felt like one, and lay down immediately to rest.</p>
        <p>When I was able to get about I went to visit Big Flurry in his three-room castle. The big fellow was indeed getting whipped, as Uncle Jim had said many years earlier. Rheumatism tortured him, beat him far over, and made his walking precarious. Prostate trouble; far more serious, required the presence of a doctor at frequent intervals.</p>
        <p>I proudly offered my gift from afar. The bowed old sailor chuckled indulgently.</p>
        <p>"Sure, Charlie-bye, ï¿½tis far too good for the likes of me! I don't be taking anything now, anyway. But I'll take it down to Gus and see what he'll give me for it."My spirits were lowered. I hated to see such fine wine peddled about this prohibiting town. I asked more questions about the Old Man's boyhood, his life in Ashtabula Harbor and Erie, and his wanderings in search of land. Again I made notes out of his amazing-memory.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="330" />I could not burden Marie with the care of a sick man, since she was working hard every day to provide for her family. She was doing a good job. The small house, was as neat and clean as any hospital room, and the children were and well-dressed and well fed. John called for me with the buggy and a broken-down horse, and I went to the farm to rest. The fresh air and idleness were medicines for me, and conversation about newspaper work in great and distant cities was wine for John. We talked endlessly, John doing most of the listening, and asking many questions. John was gray now, heavier than of old, and totally without ambition to better his condition or that of the farm.</p>
        <p>I kept up my daily verse, and read each one aloud to John. He laughed at theamusing ones, and plainly marvelled [sic] at the supposed skill that went into such composition. Alone of all the family he had never shown any talent for handling words.</p>
        <p>His letters were dull, stilted, formal, and sounded like a report from a foreignrepresentative.</p>
        <p>Spring was at hand, but John was not planning any spring plowing or planting.</p>
        <p>He was living, frugally to be sure, out of money in the bank that had been advanced on mortgages. Aunt Fannie had been a source of expense to him. Maria had forced him to take the old lady to an oculist, who said that the sight of one eye was gone, and that the other eye required a strong glass. Auntie went about the house in the remnants of some of Mother's old dresses, her own house clothes having worn out completely. She carried her rosary with her, continually telling of the beads, even when in conversation. She talked to me about her mother and my mother, but while I was answering he managed to get in a few words directly to the Mother of God.</p>
        <p>John said that Auntie was becoming a tyrant. She wouldn't even let me take a bath in the kitchen any more. He had to carry the galvanized iron tub down to the granary and carry the cold water for his bath there from the pump which stood where the windmill had been. 
        <pb n="331" />"It's a hell of a note," said John, "when a man can't take a bath in his own house."My strength and the use of legs and arms gradually improved, as I took short walks about the farm, sometimes even venturing down to the woods, where the happiest days of my boyhood had been spent. The most persistent rheumatic infection had settled in my Johnny Lynch knee, so that I still needed a heavy cane for aid. A Wichita doctor who saw me once a week reported the heart rapidly turning to complete compensation, and cheerfully told me that I might live to forty. Then, he said, the slightest cold might bring on another attack, decompersation [sic], and present death. Meantime, I should choose a less strenuous occupation than muscular journalism.</p>
        <p>After three weeks of rest and careful exercise in open air, I felt strong enough to undertake the trip back to my job. My checks had been coming through regularly, together with friendly letters from incomparable editor and members of the staff.</p>
        <p>I went around to bid goodbye to Big Flurry. He was broken now, and longed for something besides for memories. He kissed me goodbye, assuming me that this would be our last meeting on earth. He was weeping in his big chair as I left.</p>
        <p>Marie told me how Dad had recently come back to the Church. She had induced a young priest to go to the cottage and talk the Old Man into a religious mood. Big Flurry had not been interested, and had reported to Marie that the priest was a "green omathan [sic] that didn't know his arse from St. Patrick's day."Later there came to the parish an Irishman from the old sod, one of O'Sullivan, who spoke Gaelic. Joyfully, Marie arranged for a visit to the shack on South Santa Fe avenue. The two Irishmen were cronies at once. Next morning Father O'Sullivan made another visit, and administered Holy Communion. The Old Man had received the Sacrament monthly since then, in his own house, but always from the Irish priest.</p>

        <p>Briggs said that I was not fit for heavy duty yet, and had me assigned to the Governor's office in the Capitol. This was about the softest assignment that could be cooked up for me, and had previously been part of the routine duty of the statehouse reporter. I became a close friend of Governor Burnquist while I recovered strength. Most of my short day was spent in a big chair in the ante-room. All of my reports were made by telephone.</p>
        <p>One cold March Sunday afternoon, I went over to Minneapolis to interview Irvin Cobb in a hotel room. That was the beginning of a friendship that was to last until Cobb's death, almost exactly twenty-nine years later.</p>
        <p>Cobb was on a lecture tour, and was heading eastward after having covered large stretches of the Northwest. He was not feeling well, and I was sure he had a temperature that was far above normal. But he wasn't worried about himself. He said he couldn't sleep, but that was because he had been sleeping on trains for so many nights that he missed the bumping, the screeching of whistles, and, above all, the cinders in his eyes.</p>
        <p>"As a last resort, 1 had to get the bellhop to bring me a cinder and drop it in my right eye last night," he said. "Then I slept like a baby."But it turned out that he was getting, seriously ill, and it was this illness that led to his appendicitis operation and his subsequent little book, "Speaking of Operations," which shot him to the top of the pile as a writing humorist.</p>
        <p>I found Cobb easy to interview, as did all newsmen. In his last year of life, when he was feeling worn out and lonely, he said that he
        <pb n="333" />had always followed the policy of being nice to newspaper people, and had often got out of bed in the middle of the night for interviews. This had got him a lot of favorable publicity, which he had wanted, but he wondered now whether it was worth the effort and the wear and tear on his constitution. When I was ready to resume my duties as school editor I had already made a place for myself on the editorial page, contributing frequent editorials and operating a column called The Horner's Nest. Briggs suggested that I find an assistant who could do most of my school leg-work, and thus I gradually drifted out of the school specialty and into the policy end of the paper. The News printed my daily syndicated poem in a box on the last page, a good position. I was selling verse and occasional prose to a dozen magazines.</p>
        <p>I had been on full schedule of work only a few months when a wire came from Marie, saying that Big Flurry was dying. I took the next train.</p>
        <p>The prostate condition had become acute. Marie had accompanied the Old man in the ambulance to St. Francis hospital. On the way he had said, "I know I'm not coming back, and there's only one regret I have. I wanted to live long enough to build a little kitchen on that house for you. It will be your house, Marie-gaarl, and 'tis yourself that has earned it hard."And I reflected that there is always some reason why every one of us would like to live just a little longer.</p>
        <p>The big fellow had rallied from the severe operation handsomely. But the special night nurse had left a window wide open, whence blew a cold draft directly upon the patient, and pneumonia had set in. If that nurse had not slept, the Old Man might have returned to the fray. But nobody knows the factors that cause night
        <pb n="334" />nurses to sleep while on duty. Maybe she had troubles of her own.</p>
        <p>Dad was breathing hard, but could talk fairly well by dividing words and sentences between labored breaths. "Oh, Charlie-bye, ï¿½tis a shame for you to be coming so far from Minnesota to see me!" he said, as I stood by the bed.</p>
        <p>The doctor told me that pneumonia probably would conquer, as its grip had nowBeen increasing for four or five days, but the old fellow still had almost perfect heart action and other vital organs were sound.</p>
        <p>"If we could get some whiskey," he said, "we might get him through the crisis. But without the whiskey, I'm afraid we'll lose the battle."I was amazed to learn that the prohibition had so tightened since my newspaper days in the town that not even hospitals were permitted to keep it or doctors to administer it. "I'll get it," I said.</p>
        <p>I went to the Eagle and stated the case to Doze and Ferrell. Both said they could do nothing. How about the police station, where newspaper men formerly got their chief supplies from confiscated goods? Nothing doing. The police were in mortal terror of the Beacon, and every drop captured had to be accounted for. I called at the home of Johnny Mahan, former wholesale liquor man, who hadknown all of our family for a generation. Not a drop in the house. His luggage and that of his family were searched upon crossing the Kansas line, each time they returned from the East. Their house had been searched, often.</p>
        <p>I went to Tom McDermott's grocery store, on East Douglas avenue. Tom was busy, making money and serving the customers. But he said, "Just wait, Charlie, until I get some of these people out of here. I think I can do something for you."There was a telephone conversation. We drove quickly to the back yard of a shack on South Washington avenue. As we entered the back door, Tom told me to hold two dollars in my right hand. We passed along a dark passagewav, midway of which a man's hand shot out from a hole in the wall. I held out the money. A half pint
        <pb n="335." />of rotgut whiskey replaced the currency in my hand.</p>
        <p>I proudly delivered the precious though obviously inferior spirits to the nurse, and the doctor prescribed regular administration of table spoonfuls. The pneumonia was getting worse; breathing more labored.</p>
        <p>When the Old Man was conscious, and able to talk, I told him that the family had agreed that whatever property or money he should leave should be Marie's, and that we had agreed to give her quit-claim deeds to his little home, which we would inherit jointly. He was pleased, but not surprised. After all, Marie had cared for him during his last years, and was more in need of help than any of the rest of us. I asked him how much Pat Whaley owed him.</p>
        <p>"Sure, how should I know?" answered the Old man, as he had always answered that question, often asked of him through his Kansas years. "There has never been the sthroke of a pencil between Pat and me. Pat will do right by Manie. He has all my money, and 'tis himself would not kape a shilling of it afther I'm gone. It will help Manie bring up her nice childhren, and God bless her."There was no use laboring the point with a dying man, but we all knew that Pat was a notorious robber of widows, and had been robbing Big Flurry since he first set eyes on him in 1878.</p>
        <p>The last days came on apace. Speech was difficult now, and breath more difficult. Yet the giant died slowly, every vital organ fighting.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, in a moment of temporary strength, the Old Man tried to make a final testimony about some loan he had made.</p>
        <p>"Moneyï¿½Charlie Weil,..to Colorado...I can't talk."So that part of the business side of Big Flurry's life was ended, with merely the disturbing knowledge among his children that Pat Whaley was not the only one. Jim Driscoll was an Irish Catholic who was not related to our family, but 
        <pb n="336" />was a friend of Big Flurry. The family, knowing that Dad had loaned money to Jim, was satisfied that he would never get it back.</p>
        <p>Jim, a tall, graying farmer with handlebar mustache, came to the hospital when life was ebbing. He spoke to the dying man and was recognized. He knelt to pray beside the bed, sobbing violently.</p>
        <p>Rising, he said, "Mary, I owe Flurry seventy-five dollars. I must pay him before he dies. He is my old friend."He hurried out, mopping his eyes. In an hour he was back, currency in hand. He spoke near the ear of the old friend. "Here's the money I owe you, Flurry; seventy-five dollars, you remember?"Speech was almost impossible, but the Old Man gradually gasped out the sentence, "God bless you, Jim."Again the big Irishman fell to his knees, repeating, half audibly, the prayers for the dying. We had misjudged one more of Big Flurry's friends.</p>
        <p>The Old Man's left hand tightened over the bills that Jim had placed in his palm. He sank into the final coma, and spoke no more. Hours later, Marie and I had to pry the fingers open, so that the priest and nuns night not be scandalized by the sight of a Corkonian dying with a fistful of money instead of a crucifix in his hand.</p>
        <p>The funeral was in a commercial funeral home. Thousands passed beside the coffin, thousands remained to pray for the stordy [sic] pioneer who had gone. They all knew him as an honest man, a hard worker, a good farmer, and a good friend.</p>
        <p>He was 84 years old, according to available records. Abundance of long, curly, thick white hair above the strong countenance, made a picturesque figure. Thus might Lincoln have looked, had he been spared for the span
        <pb n="337" />of life his physical structure forecast. I may have mentioned that Dad did not believe in shampoos. He never owned a toothbrush, but cleaned his teeth with twigs from living trees. His gleaming white teeth went to the grave with him, all but one. And he had chewed tobacco as long as I knew him, besides smiking [sic] pipe and cigars.</p>
        <p>The long battle was over for the sailor and fisherman from the Bay of Roaring Water. Far from his green fields and hills, far from his tempestuous ocean, we laid him down on the barren hilltop, alongside the wife whom he had not seen so long, and whom he had never really known.</p>
        <p>Aunt Fannie said the casket was too cheap, and that the family did not provide enough carriages for the funeral.</p>
        <p>As the body descended into the earth, I turned away and sought my north-bound train. Here at last was a tragedy ended, as tragedies do end.</p>
        <p>__________I was sensible of the breaking of ties, long thought essential, as I listened to the sad threnody of steel wheels upon steel rails. I must be about the business of making a place of some sort for myself in this confused world.</p>
        <p>It was being borne in upon me by daily experience that I should not look forward to a lifetime of newspaper work in St. Paul. My pay remained practically stationary, and this caused in me a slowly rising resentment against the paper, the whole business of daily journalism, and even against my valued friend and employer, Briggs. As has been my custom from the beginning, I refrained from asking for an increase in salary. I believed, and still believe, that no man or woman should be obliged to earn his living and also beg for it. It is one of the 
        <pb n="338" />cardinal faults of our economy that some employers will accept high-grade services at low pay, so long as some threat is not poised over their heads, with the consequence that the whiners, beggars and bluffers on the payroll go up rapidly, while the worthy and talented who refuse to sit up and beg are passed by.</p>
        <p>For a vacation period I substituted for the bureau manager of the United Press, whose office was on our editorial floor. I absorbed an extremely low opinion of press association labors. On this lowest round of the U.P. ladder the job required no brains whatever, but a loud and durable voice, with rapid speech. Every half hour or so you had to "do the ponies."This meant that you had, during the twenty or thirty minutes preceding, digested the press report into exactly the number of words for a certain string of pony clients. A pony service is a cheap, telephoned version of the regular wire service, and was sold, at that time, by the struggling U.P., at ridiculously low rates.</p>
        <p>With your boiled-down version of the day's news before you, you stood in a stinking telephone booth, as soon as the bell rang, and read, in a flat, sing-song tone, the copy, into the ears of stenographers who worked for the string of little papers that were clients for this particular hour's service. There were many strings, paying varying prices per week for varying lengths of telephoning. Hookups were arranged by the telephone company on a contract basis. You must talk fast, but only so fast as the slowest stenographer could take it. You must not put any expression or emphasis into any of the stuff. I was always, behind schedule, because I couldn't learn to read like Floyd Gibbons, who had been an ideal bureau man but a rather dumb reporter, during his newspaper career in the Twin Cities.</p>
        <p>I was interested to learn that the man who had the regular bureau job, and for whom I was substituting, was, in the opinion of his superiors,
        <pb n="339" />destined for high places in the organization. He could talk fast and colorlessly, jump from one phone to another rapidly, and sell pony service to little newspapers in a workmanlike manner. He was personally dirty, unshaven, uncombed, unwashed. But he was on his way up, stood well with the New York office, and might have become president in his later years had he not, while still in St. Paul, been arrested for misconduct with a little girl. I did not think I wanted a press association career, and was glad when I could go back to my desk and my place in the Daily News "family."Our paper was sympathetic with the movement then known as the Nonpartisan League. This was obviously a suicidal sympathy, so far as the business end of the paper was concerned. The Nonpartisan League, with headquarters in Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota, was a radical political organization, fostering cooperative enterprises among farmers, with a strong bid for radical labor support.</p>
        <p>Cooperative stores, elevators, banks, mills, packing houses, and wholesale houses did no advertising, and that was one reason why they could sell below the price level of ordinary merchandising concerns. I looked wonderingly, perhaps dumbly, at Briggs and Colver, chief champions of the co-ops, as I asked, "Where will the paper get its income if all or most of the merchandising goes co-op?"Some of the heaviest advertisers in St. Paul were asking the same question, in a wickedly pointed manner. I smelled trouble. In the language of Big Flurry, I said to my confidential friend, Vaughan, "I guess I best be going!"Because I had written many of the editorials in favor of the Nonpartisan League movement and in defense of the elder Bob Lafollette and his Wisconsin liberal movement, I was offered the job of editor
        <pb n="340" />of the League's national organ, the Nonpartisan Leader. The salary was to start at about twice what I was being paid by the News, and, because the co-op movement seemed headed for great success, the job was tempting.</p>
        <p>But I sensed growing political turbulence in the League and Lafollette movements. Professional politicians were infiltrating. Political jealousies, bickering, jockeying, tale-telling, back-scratching and foot-kissing already were boiling in the stew of cooperative farmer-labor politics. I didn't like it. I asked for two weeks to consider and investigate.</p>
        <p>Meantime, there came to our town an investigation of the packing companies by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p>I was called from my desk, where I was having fun with the fashioning of a daily column, and asked by Editor Arthur Vance: "Do you think you could spare a day or two to cover the Federal Trade investigation for us?"We were anti-packer, as was the F.T.C. This was a policy story. But I didn't crave reportorial work any longer. I wanted to write columns and editorials. Sullenly, ungraciously, I accepted the assignment.</p>
        <p>The hearings, lasting a week, were held in a large room in the St. Paul hotel. Typewriters were not permitted, so I wrote my copy in pencil, longhand, on large copy sheets. A messenger stood by. When I had a dozen sheets written, he took them to the office, four blocks downhill.</p>
        <p>I wrote approximately a newspaper page of copy daily, before press time, half-past two. At least seven thousand words. It was all written for the typesetter, no editing required.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="341" />Editor Vance and Chief Editor Briggs were lavish in their comments upon this job, all done in accordance with policy, and giving as much Q &amp; A testimony as the paper could carry.</p>
        <p>On the Saturday of the closing of the inquiry, Peter Yoder, the government's examiner, a handsome, intelligent, quick-fitted former newspaperman, asked me to take lunch with him at a restaurant on St. Peter street.</p>
        <p>"How much money are you making here?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Forty-five dollars a week.""Good God! I was going to give you some good advice. But if you're that simple-minded, you need a nurse, not advice."We talked on, I red-faced end ashamed; he scornful and bitter.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to do Briggs any harm, but my conscience is clear if I take a simple-minded country jake away from him before Briggs starves him to death. Would you like to work in New York?"Yes, I wanted to go to New York.</p>
        <p>"Well, Roy Howard, my old boss, asked me to be on the lookout for new ivory on this trip, and if you're not ivory your skull is. What's your military status? There's a war, you know.""Turned down by Officers Training and all the services in the Mexican fuss, also by the draft recently, and by Red Cross and Friends Service.""You must be dead.""That's what the doctors say. Bad heart and eyes. So I've decided to get married as soon as I can afford it. I have a nice girl here in St. Paul. See, here's a picture of her!""Uh-huh! Well, don't say anything to Briggs about it, but I'll tell Howard, and you'll probably hear from Old Ed Conkle, manager of
        <pb n="342" />bureaus. You'll have to make your own bargain about pay, so I suppose you'll starve in New York, too."During the next week I had to make a decision. Two of three decisions, maybe. I hadn't yet told the girl that I was going to marry her, and maybe she wouldn't like the idea at all. The Nonpartisan Leader Job would wait no longer. And I had a definite offer from Ed Conkle, immediate decision demanded.</p>
        <p>I turned down the Nonpartisan Job by phone. Next man in line, far more competent than I, got it, and worked several years before the Communists murdered him because of his opposition to their efforts to control the Movement.</p>
        <p>I told the girl that I would come back and get her when I had saved enough money to buy an engagement ring, and with a suitcase, a briefcase and a typewriter, boarded a train for New York, the Unknown. Around my heart there was a chill, and the old loneliness I had so often felt since childhood lay like a dark cloud over me.</p>
        <p>New York, New York, New York!</p>
        <p>__________
        <pb n="343" /></p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="I">
        <p>"All but six!" shouted the scarlet-faced, tobacco-chewing, good-natured E. J. Conkle, grasping my hand in hearty welcome to New York and my new job on United Press. A short, fat man, with a record of long service for this not-so-old press corporation in many cities, he remembered me from the brief visit I had with him in his Chicago office, several years earlier. He was the only man in the organization whom I had ever met before. He was the oldest man in the New York office, largely manned by youths who didn't demand large salaries, but appreciated the experience. He moved slowly, never was exited, and looked with amused tolerance upon the shouting and racing of the frenetic workers in the big news room.</p>
        <p>He led me by the hand into his little office, at the rear of the newsroom, sat heavily in his swivel chair, and said amiably, "Glad to see you, Charlie! God damn! All but six!"He told me that he was-now manager of bureaus for the entire country, that I would have the desk next to his, that we would be the only two in the room, and that I was to be put to work as mail service editor. He would explain the duties later. For the present we would gossip.</p>
        <p>He asked about St. Paul, where he was as much at home as in a hundred other cities, and particularly about a problem bureau manager out there.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="344" />I said I knew the man slightly and had noticed some peculiarities in him, particularly an aversion for washing his neck.</p>
        <p>"That's a great pity," said Conkle thoughtfully, biting off another liberal chew. "He's the best, salesman we have out in that country. He'd go far with a clean neck and no brains. But we don't pay him enough to buy soap. He can read a pony report mighty fast.""Yes, I know. The clients didn't like me when I substituted for him, because I can't read so fast.""All but six!" said my new friend, languidly, "to hell with the fast talk. That's for his kind.</p>
        <p>"But you said, or somebody said, that he is absent on account of some personal troubles. Do you know what's the matter with him now?""No."
        <pb n="345" />"Well, he has more personal troubles that interfere with his work than any other man in the business. I'd fire him today if he wasn't such a good salesman. His mother is sick, his sister fell downstairs, or he wants a whole dozen of new pencils and a typewriter ribbon. God, the joint would go broke if we didn't make the bureau managers buy at least half of their office supplies! All but six." The last phrase was murmured prayerfully.</p>
        <p>We were protected from the infernal racket of the news room by the flimsy partitions of thin wood and ground glass, but, even so, had to talk in a tone louder than normal. In the news room itself, where banks of Morse telegraph instruments and a dozen of the new printers, now called teletype machines, were clattering, you had to cup your lips and shout into the ear of anybody to whom you spoke.</p>
        <p>After the Eastern and Central clients had been put to bad, the noise died somewhat, and Conkle said, "Come on; I'll introduce you to your bosses." He led me through the news room, half a block long to a row of private offices, against the far wall. Respectfully, and with a form of polite humility which I have never (to my cost) learned to adopt for any boss or potentate, he introduced me to Roy Howard, president of United Press, He explained who I was, and Roy, smiling cordially and obviously sizing up ay country clothes, said yes, he had heard of my work in Omaha and St. Paul, and hoped I'd do as well in New York. Roy was then riding the crest of his fame as the youngest press executive in the world. He has come along fast from his Indiana newspaper job, had got a place with Old Man (E.W.) Scripps on the Penny Press, ancestor of the present Cleveland Press. Scripps, a primitive sort of drunkard with new ideas in news vending, was the originator of
        <pb n="346" />the overall plan of running a newspaper on one shoestring of grocery twine. He paid the lowest wages for the worst writing of any newspaper publisher in the world, and made it pay. But Roy Howard was nobody to fool with, even if he did come from Indiana.</p>
        <p>The Penny Press got its so-called wire report from a shoestring syndicate in Brooklyn, which cribbed it out of the morning A.P. papers. One weekend Roy, who wasn't highly paid, hopped a train to Brooklyn, bought (for nothing) an option on the only available source of alleged wire news (since A. P. would not sell to Scripps), and came back, bright-eyed with anticipated victory. Old Man Scripps capitulated. Roy was in, and at a very early age.</p>
        <p>Thus was born the United Press, destined to buck the competition of its powerful Goliath, the A.P. and make good. It had not made good in a particularly spectacular way when I went to work for Roy, but it was gaining ground, what with careful attention to the number of pencils and typewriter ribbons consumed by its employes [sic].</p>
        <p>We moved on to the next office, and I met big, open-faced, hardworking William W. Hawkins, called Bill by those in the upper brackets. There was some rivalry between Bill and Roy, and, since Roy was in the money first and was Big Boss, Hawkins felt the need of justifying his existence by hard work, even though he was vice president and in line for the job of Roy.</p>
        <p>Hawkins, always agreeable but worried, shook hands made some remarks to show that he knew about my earlier work, and we passed along to the next room,There was much gossip about Bill and Roy in the office, I learned as the days passed. Each was listed in Who's Who in America as having been born in 1883, which would make both of them thirty-five years old at this time. Hawkins looked older, probably because he was a big man
        <pb n="347" />and a hard worker and worried, while Roy was a little fellow who never took on worries, but loved a parade. General opinion was that Hawkins, jealous of Roy's reputation as the boy wonder of journalism, has falsified his age in his Who's Who biography, making himself several months younger than Roy. I never gave credence to this theory, although, as the years passed, Hawkins aged much more rapidly in appearance than did Roy. I think this was duo to a more serious turn of mind, a penchant for worry, and a lack of confidence in himself that made Roy always happy,Hawkins came from Missouri, and was part of the assets (or liabilities) that Roy took over with his tour de force option on Publishers Press, the one-lunged Brooklyn syndicate with which Howard forced Old Man Scripps to whack up. Whether Hawkins helped Howard engineer that deal, I do not know. Anyway, he went with the option, and was a big man in U.P. from its formation in 1907. He was now second in command, in line for first whenever Roy should choose to step down.</p>
        <p>Next, I was presented to Karl Bickel, a sprightly, neat, energetic, intelligent man, listed officially as a year older than his two associates, but looking and acting five years younger, perhaps because he had no dignity and didn't want any.</p>
        <p>It did not escape me that plain, unpressed Ed Conkle, whom I had begun to like immensely, was more at ease with Bickel than with the other two. "Hello, Karl/" he said, "I want to show you our newest specimen. He's from your part of the country, and acted the damn fool for a while, like you did. He'll do it again, Charlie Driscoll, from Wichita, Omaha and St. Paul. All but six!" Bickel turned from his work, asked me to sit down, and started asking questions. Soon we were exchanging observations and experiences in Omaha. Along about the same time, he was partner with a wild-eyed
        <pb n="348" />radical in publication of a newspaper in Grand Junction, Colorado. This martyr had, for a time, been editor of the Wichita Eagle, and was out for blood in Colorado. Karl said it was praiseworthy effort, but seemed to be getting nowhere except the poorhouse, so he joined the U.P. He was getting along nicely. While he was a business executive perforce, he really had the literary and philosophical assets to be a chief editor. More money in the money than in words, he explained.</p>
        <p>I found Karl to be my friend from that moment on, and at this writing I still enjoy his friendship and, occasionally, his sage and kindly advice.</p>
        <p>A nervous young man with tense face muscles and a James J. Corbett pompadour was pacing the news room. I was introduced to Hugh Baillie, manager of the New York bureau. His face relaxed into a friendly smile, and Hugh said he knew I'd fit into the U.P. picture in just the right way.</p>
        <p>Back in the little office, Conkle said, "You've met the kingpins. Every one of the boys I introduced you to is going farther, and clear to the top. You might think Roy Howard is at the top now, being president. But he'll figure out something bigger for himself, and a bigger salary. The others will all be president in turn."He spat toward the spittoon, and added, as if compulsively, under his breath, "All but six!" the prediction has been fulfilled to the letter, and Hugh Baillie, the boy wonder from California, born in Brooklyn, is president as this is written, and has been for thirteen years, a long term for presidents of such corporations.</p>
        <p>Concerning him, Conkle said, "Baillie is born U.P. man, I'm not. I'm just as ignorant old newspaperman, and got into U.P. too late to get anywhere. But I'm satisfied.</p>
        <p>"Hugh was in college in California when Old Man Scripps met him.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="349" />E.W. liked the fellow's push and dash, hard work and hard play. He watched him along time, and then got acquainted. He said ï¿½Boy would you like to work for me when you get through school?'So, according to Conkle, Scripps told his top men to take on this youngster and train him for the presidency of U.P. When he was dead, he said, he wanted men like that running the business.</p>
        <p>Hugh has taken the training that was the Scripps prescription for a top-flight U.P. man. He did not finish college, which was all right with Old Man Scripps. In fact, the old gentleman, who was at this time 63 years old and living mostly on his yacht, scooting hither and yon in a vain attempt to get away from himself and his relatives, had no education whatever, and picked college men only if the college virus seemed not to have infiltrated too deeply.</p>
        <p>Baillie was the kind of newspaperman who could take any assignment when he was taking, and give any kind when he was giving, exited as the storm of war news came roaring over the wires, he could retreat from the noise to one of the offices and smile as he talked. He seldom sat down. The habit of leaning over to pick up a telephone, instead of taking a seat, became so ingrained that even today, when his blond pompadour has turned white, his characteristic pose, known to his associates, is bending his long frame over the desk and picking up the instrument while standing.</p>
        <p>"And now let me introduce you to the Brains," said Conkle. Just outside our cabin door, where the roar of the telegraph machines was great, but not deafening, a small, dark, thoughtful-looking little man was walking up and down, hands clasped behind him, eyes mostly upon the floor. He was the only human being in the place who walked slowly, and with regular cadence,"Mr. Mason, this is our new man from the West, Driscoll. This is J.W.T. Mason. You don't see him running himself to death, just because there's a war going on. You never hear him yelling 
        <pb n="350" />slaughter house. But he's the smartest of all of them."He paused, as Mason and I shook hands, and added, spitting on the floor, "All but six."Mason spoke calmly, loud enough to be heard over the clatter of the machines, but no louder. Before we went back into our cubbyhole, Conkle said to Mason, "You and Driscoll will have a good time. He's got a lot of that think-stuff, too."Mason was not an Officer of the Line. He was not slated for any higher job than the one he now held, although he, too, so-called wire service. [sic]He was called the war critic of the U.P. He had a chair and a small stenographer's second-hand desk, in the passageway outside the door of our hideaway. He spent his time pacing up and down because there was little else to do. Perhaps two or three times during the day an office boy would hand him a piece of yellow flimsy, on which was war news the news editor thought Mason might like to comment upon. Always, one of these sheets bore the official war comminique of the day. Mason would put on his heavy-lensed glasses and, seated, would scan the dispatch near-sightedly. He would think for a few minutes, slip a thick book of flimsy and carbon sheets into his wheezy old typewriter and write, near the top, the line:By J.W.T. Mason.</p>
        <p>then he would type, slowly but perfectly, his critical comment,pointing out the probable movements to follow this one, the reasons for the tactics used, and a summary as to loss or gain for our side. The comment almost never exceeded one page, double space. Usually it was mugh [sic] more brief,The U.P. wires carried at least one brief Mason dispatch each day. Sometimes there were several, if events moved fast on several fronts. Mason was forty-three years old at that time, and considered by
        <pb n="351" />the brass hats to be too old, too conservative and too thoughtful to count as possible big U.P. timber.</p>
        <p>There was a distinct, definite, continuing and constant prejudice against all forms and manifestations of thinking, thought, thinkers and intelligence, not only in the United Press, but in all subsidiary activities in which Mr. Howard was in any way interested.</p>
        <p>This was not an indicator of Roy's cultural background, sketchy though it may have been, but rather an index of the faithful following of the E.W. Scripps pattern of catering to the taste of the penny public. Roy, having outsmarted the Old Man in one of the business deals of the century, was smart enough to retain in his business the principles which made Scripps and his millions of dollars possible. Reach under! Report the universe to the multitude! For this you do not need philosophers [sic], and J.W.T Mason was primarily a philosopher [sic], Roy didn't need Mason, but in his deal with Publishers Press, Mason may have been a commodity.</p>
        <p>So Mason had his fouled-up little desk, his wiggily old Oliver typewriter, and space in which to pace the wage-earning hours away.</p>
        <p>I hope it is not necessary to say, at this point, that Mason was unhappy, deeply frustrated, and seeking outlet in thinking of the values of which those surrounding his daily life were totally unaware,I learned that Mason was chiefly interested in philosophy, and spent as much time as possible listening to his modest, grave speculations upon the conduct of man. At the time I was still somewhat under the influence of Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer, but, being in love, I was trying to squirm my way out of Schopenhauer's caustic, deadly estimate of women. What had impressed me as smart and incisive a vew [sic] years earlier now seemed to me a challenge, I must prove to myself that women were not as bad, selfish and false as the German philosopher [sic] had painted them. Mason was a great help.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="352." />So he wrote a book of philosophy entitled "Creative Freedom." Somewhere in my library is an autographed copy. I valued it highly and never understood what it was about.</p>
        <p>__________There was a tall, blond, smiling young man from Indianapolis, Johnson by name, who seemed always to be walking back and forth beside a table, perhaps 30 feet long, on which were piled the yellow flimsies from all the receiving wires. Johnson who chewed gum constantly, moistened the long finger of his right hand, as he dumped the flimsy on the floor. For this busy elimination of news, he was called news editor, He gave a quick glance at the item, pressed his finger on it, and, with quick motion, pulled it toward him and let it drop. The floor was ankle-deep in flimsy at the end of every day. Here lay the untold story of the world's doings, of battles fought and of thousands dead. For every word that want [sic] out to clients on the wires, perhaps a thousand were tossed upon the floor and never printed in any newspaper.</p>
        <p>One day I saw Hawkins, who had just emerged from his little office, standing as if transfixed, watching young Johnson's editing. After a few minutes, Hawkins walked over to the table, stooped, picked up a sheet of flimsy from the floor, and slammed it down on the table in front of Johnson.</p>
        <p>Hawkins kept his eyes on the flimsy. And he said, to nobody in particular, but within the hearing of the young destroyer, "From Vladivostock. Two dollars a word!"Johnson said nothing, waited until Hawkins had left the room, and once again cast the expensive wordage upon the floor, I asked him about it that evening, as we ate doughnuts and coffee together,What the hell do I care how much a word he pays for this stuff?" he said. "He has a dumb guy over there because he won't pay enough to get a good man. I throw all his stuff away."

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="II">
        <p>My job as mail service editor was much too easy. Upon my desk was dumped all the copy that came from United Press correspondents by rail. I had a sheet, smaller than a newspaper page, called Red Letter, and another, once a week, called Sunday Letter. I could fill both of them out of any one day's mail, and I could throw both of them together in an afternoon, without too much bustle. Consequently, I had too much time on my hands.</p>
        <p>I introduced the innovation of a poem in each copy of the Sunday Letter, and sometimes idled away almost a day writing and rewriting it. This, I realized, was a slovenly habit, and would do me no good. I asked for more work. Conkle spat a stream of tobacco past me, eyed me humorously, and said, "Hell, boy, take it easy! You're used to being driven like a slave by those half-ass Scripps boys out West. You don't have to work that hard to make a living in this town."I said I saw a lot of fellows running around like mad here all the time. He said, "They're all showing off." Then, out of the other corner of his mouth, as he pulled toward him the dictating machine, he mumbled. "All but six!"Conkle, sitting within a few feet of me, dictated endless strings of letters to bureau managers, all over the country. Although he spoke in a low tone, the dictation spoiled any writing that I might be doing. It distracted my attention.</p>
        <p>I took to writing love letters to my girl in St. Paul, during office hours, in order to use the time. Since Conkle was constantly on the move, between our cell and the news room, he could look over my shoulder and see, on my typewriter, what I was writing. This made me nervous. It wasn't an ideal office arrangement.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="354" />Almost every afternoon, Conkle would relax, spit out a stupendous load of chewing tobacco (Star Flag), and start friendly conversation. I learned a lot about the U.P. and its personnel during these relaxing sessions. Conkle smoked immense cigars when he was not chewing. Naturally, he had high blood pressure, and was beginning to experience the excruciating terrors of bronchial asthma. He didn't seen to worry about these matters, and continued to drink enough whiskey to keep him on his toes during working hours. One of the ties between us was that we both knew George Martin, with whom I had worked in Omaha. In fact, George and his wife, Ruthie, were the only people I knew in New York upon my arrival, except for Conkle, whom I had met once, for brief conversation, in Chicago.</p>
        <p>I told Conkle that one of my bitterer disappointments upon arrival In New York was learning that George, my old friend, was out of town, and would be for a month. Yes, my new friend assured me, George certainly was out of town. He had come East after the debacle in Omaha. Yes, I remembered that I was in St. Paul at that time, and, after he had been fired from the Omaha Daily News, George had written, asking for a loan so that he might rent a typewriter. He said that typewriter would take him to New York, and that he would remember me when he should come into his kingdom. I sent him the money, and the typewriter turned out magazine copy that paid his way to New York.</p>
        <p>The Crowell Company was just helping to its feet its newest infant, called "Every Week," with a westerner named Bruce Barton as editor. Barton had seen some of Martin's work, and took him on as associate editor. The weekly looked like a sure winner, but, of course, was costing neat bookkeeping losses at the start. After a brief existence, the Crowell people killed it. Too difficult to get paper under wartime conditions, and the future of any new publication,
        <pb n="355" />while the world was absorbed in destruction, was too uncertain. Barton was retained for work on the other Crowell publications. All the rest of the staff was firedï¿½except George Martin. George convinced the executives of the parent company that he was indispensable. So, having no magazine job for him, they sent him on a mission to Canada, to find out how magazines had fared in wartime there, since they had been in the war long before this country.</p>
        <p>The mission was supposed to last a week. George was to go from office to office, smoke some good cigars, ask questions of executives, and return with a report.</p>
        <p>George had been gone a month now. He had learned that Canadian publishers kept only sketchy records, that executives seldom knew, whether they were making money or losing. Despite a loathing for figures that he and I had shared from the first day of our acquaintanship [sic], George had gone to work on the books of one publisher after another.</p>
        <p>Shortly after my talk about him with Conkle, George returned with a masterful report on Canadian publication conditions.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the Crowell people found him an editorial job in their organization, where he began to make his influence felt.</p>
        <p>George had served an interim period In New York in the very job I now held.</p>
        <p>"But you'll never be as good as George, nor as crazy," said Conkle. "He wasn't a U.P. man. He has brains and originality. When he took over the Red Letter it was a mimeographed sheet. He sold the brass hats the idea of printing it, and they parted with the extra money with some awful bearing-down pains. Then he styled it and put a lot of his own humorous stuff into it. He was much too good for this outfit, and somebody soon found it out. If we could just hold
        <pb n="356" />on to some talent like that, we'd be attracting public attention. But that's not for us. Watch George! He'll do all right."So we exchanged many anecdotes of the incomparable George, of his suicidal mania, his deep depressive periods, and his whimsical humor.</p>
        <p>__________On my first day in New York I had taken a furnished room in the attic of a rooming-and-boarding house on Morningside Heights, just off the Columbia university campus. Johnson, the news editor, was my neighbor, two doors down the street.</p>
        <p>The domestic surroundings were depressing, discouraging. The attic, five stories up, was cramped, bare, inhospitable. There was no elevator. I was told that I would have to leave whenever the rightful tenant should return, and that she was a secretary to Helen Gould, just now on detached duty somewhere.</p>
        <p>The landlady was the most artificial and pretentious lady it had been my fortune to meet, up to this time. She had a differential between bust and waist that was spectacular, and all in favor of bust. Upon this monumental protuberance she draped jewels of all sorts, mostly diamonds. She presided at meals in queenly fashion. But she couldn't pay the iceman. Whenever he was announced, storming in the kitchen for his overdue money, she would run upstairs, where her virginal sister, with whom she was eternally fighting, lived.</p>
        <p>"Oh, Virginia! The iceman! Get out my diamond necklace at once!"She shouted and puffed her way up the long stairs, and in a quarter of an hour, resplendent in jewels and war paint, she descended in dignity to meet the outraged iceman and put him off another week.</p>
        <p>The place was so disturbing to my peace of mind that I sought other quarters in the neighborhood, and eventually found a cell on the floor of an ancient rooming house on West One Hundred Eighteenth
        <pb n="357" />street. There was an elevator, but it seldom worked. The old lady who leased the place was a displaced Texan, and her daughter, suffering from a guilt complex because she had brought her nether to New York many decades ago, was a social worker, laboring in the Harlem vineyard. The place was infested with bedbugs, but so were all these houses, I was told.</p>
        <p>I opened a savings account in the Emigrant Industrial bank, a short walk from the U. P. offices in Park Row, and deposited a fixed portion of my wages each week. Outside of rent, I allowed myself one dollar a day for all expenses. Some day I would have enough for an engagement ring, and then we would be married. I was desperately lonely, and the rushing crowds, expressionless, cold, seemingly oppressed by the same loneliness that plagued me, frightened me, lest I grow old in such an inhuman atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Each winter morning I had breakfast at a snail shop on Amsterdam avenue. Coffee and two crullers, ten cents. Luncheon at the Automat or Merchants Buffet, twenty-five cents. Dinner in a campus tearoom might come to half a dollar. No tips. My reading matter came from the office, where mountains of newspapers from all over the world were available daily. I was always hungry, thin and anemic, but on rare occasions, observing how much I had saved out of my daily allowance, I had my one Sunday meal on the campus, with meat and ice cream, for 90 cents, and there might be money left for a subway ride and an exploring stroll in some part of New York altogether alien to me. I bought no clothes.</p>
        <p>I took an hour or a little more at noon, and since the brief luncheon took only a few minutes, walked to the Battery, to Wall street, and to the wharves where the fish care in. This was a new
        <pb n="358" />world indeed. It began to have a compelling charm for me, and I walked farther and farther afield. My only regret was that I had nobody with whom to talk about the strange sights and smells of this amazing city.</p>
        <p>Johnson, the smiling flimsy-tosser, told me he was going to the war presently, and asked if we might spend a Sunday strolling and talking. I sensed that he was as lonely as I was, and as everybody else seemed to be in this seething mass of lost souls. So I agreed to meet him about noon at the office in the World building.</p>
        <p>We walked to the Battery, had a sentimental look at the Statue, and Johnson remarked that he probably would be seeing her from a front-view position one of these days. Idly, we walked northward along the bank of the Hudson. Johnson had not seen much of New York, and wasn't interested. He liked Indiana such better. But we talked on, talking the dreads and hopes and plans of young men, stopping occasionally by leaning up against a pier shed or a brick wall. Johnson confided that he was to be inducted this week.</p>
        <p>As we stood, talking lazily, beside a freight shed, a mouse ran out and Johnson instinctively stepped on it, crushing its life out in an instant.</p>
        <p>We walked on. My companion remarked, after a long silence, "Gee, I wish I hadn't stepped on that mouse!"Late in the afternoon, as we looked across it the Palisades of the Hudson, the young man who so soon was to be up to his neck in human slaughter, far from home, was pensive. Tears were on his cheeks as he said in a breaking voice, "I don't feel good about killing that mouse. I wish I hadn't."We got as far as the Yonkers railway station of the New York
        <pb n="359" />Central when we decided to turn back. It was late when we reached Morningside Heights, and we ate a big dinner. I never saw Johnson again, and, with a name like that, he proved difficult to trace.</p>
        <p>__________Edwin Franko Goldman's band played concerts on the green, a small grassy space on the campus, two nights a week, during the summer. It was a means of passing the hot summer evenings, and I enjoyed the music.</p>
        <p>I sat alone. The campus was swarming with schoolteachers from Out There, crossing the summer courses for points that might improve their standings in their local schools, and, at the same time, seeking a taste of Big City romance. Band concert nights were famous in the teaching world as spots for rare romance. But I was moody, lonesome for my Minnesota sweetheart, and shied away from campus contacts, though the sight of the love-raking couples under all the trees made me uncomfortable. Sleep through the hot nights, in my little cell under the roof, was not always satisfactory, and I railed against the insistent bedbugs.</p>
        <p>My first assignment outside the office was an interview with Henry Van Dyke, noted Presbyterian clergyman, author, lecturer, and member of the Princeton faculty. He had recently retired as United States minister to The Netherlands, and I was to ask him whether he thought Holland would enter the war, and if so, on which side. This seemed an important question at the time.</p>
        <p>According to the newspaper practice I had learned out West, one does not ask the assigning editor any questions, but goes out and gets the story. So I proceeded to try to find Dr. Van Dyke. It wasn't as easy as finding a politician in Omaha, but I eventually located him in an apartment in Central Park West. Knowing no way of getting to that
        <pb n="360" />address, I took a trolley car. After riding for several hours I left the car and talked to a policeman. He told me to take a subway. I did, and eventually was in the presence of the illustrious scholar, in his calm drawing room.</p>
        <p>Reportorial instinct told me that this Princeton scholar and diplomat would not be an easy nut to crack for information and opinion, but a method of approach struck me as I entered the room.</p>
        <p>"It is a privilege I've sought a long time, Dr. Van Dyke," I said. "I've wanted for years to acknowledge a debt I owe you. I won the Bible prize in a Presbyterian school solely because I liked your writing and had studied your little book, 'The Blue Flower.' The single problem of the contest was to spot the Biblical quotations and references and give their sources and meanings. Not because I knew the Bible well, but because I knew your charming story, I won the prize, ten dollars, which I needed badly."We were friends at once, and the austere Doctor talked freely. I wrote the interview before the work day closed, and Conkle spat voluably [sic], after talking with Howard. His verdict: "The big roosters are surprised that you can read and write, Charlie. Especially write. I knew it all the time. You can write rings around all of them." Long pause. "All but six!"Fortunately, I had learned that it's a good idea to know something about your subject before tackling anybody for an interview.</p>
        <p>I was to re-learn this valuable lesson, with reverse English, on my next assignment. Conkle handed me a message from our Washington bureau. It said, "Thomas Masaryk at Roosevelt hotel, New York.""I guess you're elected to interview this coot," said Conkle. He watched me as I read the slip, then grinned and spat.</p>
        <p>"Don't ask me who he is," he said. "Sounds like Armenian relief, 
        <pb n="361" />and that's most likely what he is. He may be worth a stick if he's just in from Armenia."I found my way to Masaryk's private office through aisles of desks, manned by secretaries, stenographers, typists and important-looking gentlemen. Conversation was in low tones, and in a language entirely foreign to me. I remarked to myself that I hoped my interviewee could speak English, and that I would never have to learn Armenian, if that was what they were speaking.</p>
        <p>Dr. Masaryk received me cordially, but with a dignified restraint that is often found in men of place in Europe. He did not volunteer information or put on an act, as the more press-conscious Americans often do. He was a handsome man of 67 years, with a well- trimmed white beard and keen eyes.</p>
        <p>After sparring for several minutes for some sort of clue as to what the significance of this handsome foreigner's mission might be, and getting plain answers in perfect English, I sprung the high-priced question: "How is the situation in Armenia coming along? Is American relief getting through, and what are the results as you have observed them?""I fear that's a subject I know nothing about," replied my host, almost freezing me in my tracks. "I have had little opportunity to study the problem or observe operations so far away."After a few more fumblings about the weather and New York, I left, bewildered, but not defeated. I was determined to get something to print about this mysterious person with the abundance of sang froid.</p>
        <p>As I passed through the outer offices I spotted a distinguished-looking young man in good clothing, evidently not tailored in America.</p>
        <p>He was standing near the exit from the quiet beehive, which had
        <pb n="362" />many of the appearances of an American presidential candidate's headquarters, but was minus the noise. Occasionally somebody approached him in a respectful manner, and there were exchanged a few sentences.</p>
        <p>I introduced myself, and asked my first question: "Who is the old duffer with the whisker, in the inner office?""That is my father," he replied in perfect English, and without any indication that I had made a slight indentation in the china shop. "He is Thomas Masaryk; my name is Jan Masaryk.""Well, what does your father do for a living? You see, I'm supposed to get an interview with him, and I don't know what it's all about.""He is president of the University of Prague at present.""Prague? In Bohemia?""Well, it was Bohemia. Beginning today, it is Czecho-Slovakia.""Would you spell it for me, please?"He wrote it on my pad.</p>
        <p>After a few more questions, the agreeable young man, who was almost exactly my own age, took me to a private office and explained that the name of the new country was not painted on the door of this establishment because it had been definitely settled upon only last night, and it was to be announced to the world today, with the news that Great Britain was extending its recognition of the new republic. His father would be president of Czecho-Slovakia, at least until elections could be held.</p>
        <p>The elder Masaryk had been with President Wilson in Washington for several days, straightening out boundaries and deciding upon the name. He explained that he would appreciate it if we would refrain from calling the country Bohemia, since that word was resented by some factions in the mixed-nationality area which was now about to be
        <pb n="363" />unified.</p>
        <p>Young Mr. Masaryk spent an hour making things as clear as possible for me. I went back to the office with one of the scoops of the year.</p>
        <p>I had begun to learn something about the manners and forebearance [sic] of truly cultured human beings.</p>
        <p>__________When George Martin came back to town he and his charming Ruthie invited me to dinner at their apartment on Edgecombe avenue, far uptown. The building interested me, because it was one of the tallest in that part of town, thirteen stories high, and seemed to be the beginning of a new and promising residential section. As this is written the apartment house is difficult to locate among its towering neighbors, all occupied by Negroes.</p>
        <p>George and Ruthie seemed to be happy and prosperous. George had been made associate editor of Farm &amp; Fireside, an old and respected publication of the Crowell group, heretofore mentioned as having long been edited by Herbert Quick. George knew he was in line for the editorship, and had many ideas about transformation of the old-fashioned format and injection of modern ideas into the contents.</p>
        <p>After a fine dinner and talk of old times in Omaha, George asked me if I would like to take over his job as associate editor when he should ascend the ladder another step.</p>
        <p>Knowing that I was to be married soon, George took me aside and gave me sage and sound advice concerning the facts of life and matrimony. To this day I am grateful to him for this half hour of frank discussion, and wish all prospective brides and bridegrooms might be similarly advised by one whose friendship is valued. The present sorrow of George's life was the absence of children in his home. He
        <pb n="364" />had bought a fine house in Bronxville when he felt prosperity coming on, but recently had sold it and his car and come into the city to live. He explained that they couldn't keep the house in Westchester county because of the flood of relatives and visiting firemen who came, stayed and flourished like deep-rooted green bay trees. Maybe this was one reason for the change. Another, surely, was that they realized that the home would never be populated with their own children, and so it seemed empty, despite the relatives and firemen.</p>
        <p>I answered the question concerning a change of jobs with an enthusiastic affirmative. Although I was well trained in the Scripps newspaper tradition, I saw no future for me in the United Press or any other Scripps or Scripps-Howard organization. My primary business was writing, and the SOH organizations had little use for writers or their products. No top executive could write a simple statement, such as an interview or a declaration of policy, without making many dull errors after days and nights of rewriting.</p>
        <p>There was a cable editor or foreign service editor (the titles were diffuse and confusing) by the name of Harold Jacobs, who occupied, rather quietly, a desk in the roaring news room on the third floor of the World (Pulitzer) building.</p>
        <p>Jacobs was a short, stout, friendly young man who wore thick lenses, worked hard, and was ambitious to get ahead with the organization. He was not brilliant, but he was a good rudder, as they say at the tracks, and capable of a lot of work. He stood in awe of the conspicuously successful men in U.P., and hoped to emulate their ways and their triumphs.</p>
        <p>Jacobs came from Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he broke in as a cub
        <pb n="365" />reporter under the then young H.B.R. BrJggs. For some notable blunder, Briggs fired him, and, in an angry lecture, advised him to get out of newspaper work and sell ribbons or some other product not requiring brains for selling.</p>
        <p>It has been my observation that this is one sure formula for making reporter mad enough to fight for success. It was so in the case of Jacobs. Without an oversupply of what it is supposed to take, Jacobs climbed, slowly and painfully, the ladder of journalistic achievement. Each time he had a promotion or an increase in pay, he wired Briggs, wherever he happened to be, reporting this negation of the editor's advice and prediction. Jacobs really hated Briggs. I revered Briggs as the best editor under whom 1 had worked. Aside from this, Jacobs and I got along agreeably. I confess that I was somewhat embarrassed when, upon our first meeting, Jacobs said, "Please don't take me for a Jew. Jacobs is often a Jewish name, but I'm of Dutch origin, Christian altogether." I had not yet sensed the New York Atmosphere. I did not realize that it could make any difference whether you were a Jew or a Christian, so far as personal friendship was concerned.</p>
        <p>Jacobs became more or less famous in the newspaper world somewhat later as the author of a cablese [sic] instruction to our Rome correspondent, whose name was Cianfarra.</p>
        <p>Cianfarra was not exactly United Press timber. He was a well-educated European, and took journalism seriously. He was in a key spot, and was had inexpensively, so the New York office could not laugh off his heavy dispatches, in which he reported political and military news with a classical background and references to similar situations in the times of the Caesars and Herodotus.</p>
        <p>I had stacks of long typewritten discussions by Cianfarra for
        <pb n="366" />consideration as Red Letter material, but seldom used any of them, because of their slow pace.</p>
        <p>Jacobs, impatient with expensive themes on philosophy and history by cable, sent his message to Cianfarra:"Think stuff unwanted. Send news."Years later Cianfarra, by that time a good American journalist, wrote about his experience with U.P. for the American Mercury. Title: "Think Stuff Unwanted." It was a scorching elucidation of press association shallowness.</p>
        <p>__________As summer wore on, in the year 1918, an agreement was reached by mail, whereby the matter of the engagement ring was to be deferred, and the money available spent for essential furniture. A date was set, and I began reading the department store ads. I rented a three-room apartment in a new walk-up building in the Bronx, on University avenue, close to the Bronx end of the Washington bridge. I trade a down payment of a month's rent, $36, for the month of October. This was going to be good.</p>
        <p>Signing papers and checks made me feel extremely important as a prospective head of a household.</p>
        <p>At one great department store I bought a solid mahogany drop-leaf dining table and two chairs. At another a bed and all the fixings, spring, mattress, blankets, quilts, sheets. Ruthie Martin was a guide in this purchasing, and everything was approved by mail from St. Paul. I paid cash for each item, a practice I still follow, although it is almost unheard of in New York, a city of charge accounts, and gets one into plenty of trouble. I gave each store, the gas company, electric company, and all other services a week, beginning October first, in which to deliver. Most of the orders were registered two 
        <pb n="367" />months in advance of delivery date, and the superintendent (janitor) of the apartment house had orders to admit all deliveries. So I had nothing to worry about. I wrote my young lady, "Everything will be ready for us to move in." I didn't know about New York.</p>
        <p>I even made arrangements at St. Patrick's Cathedral for the marriage, two months in advance. A priest, not notably on the ball, took the data for publication of the banns and the dispensation necessary for marriage outside the bride's parish. All would be well. All bills were paid, contracts and leases signed, and lots of time to burn.</p>
        <p>That's not the way to do business in New York, but it took me some years to learn.</p>
        <p>I was getting to work at seven o'clock in the morning now, to cover possible early emergencies. On the morning of October 4, 1918, the emergency happened. As I took my seat at my ancient Oliver typewriter, the world shuddered. The windows rattled, the floor heaved.</p>
        <p>A building employe [sic] came headlong into the room, threw the window open wide, rushed on to other rooms. I asked the cause of the disturbance. He did not answer.</p>
        <p>But the answer was not long delayed. High Baillie, flash message in hand, stood at my door.</p>
        <p>"Get out to Perth Amboy on the next train!" he shouted. Hugh was happy. Emergency, explosion, fire alarm. These were wine to him. He had a cab waiting for me by the time I had run down the stairs to the street. The elevators in the old building were to slow. First reports merely said that Perth Amboy was being destroyed by a series of explosions. Because of the vibrations in Manhattan, subway service in the lower part of the island was immediately suspended. Police and firemen tried to reach all citizens with orders to open
        <pb n="368" />windows to lessen the check in buildings.</p>
        <p>As I passed through the gate at the Hudson tunnels guards were posting signs, "Closed" and "Service Suspended." "Run, boy, if you want to catch the last train to Jersey!" shouted the guard. I caught the last train through the tubes that day.</p>
        <p>On the train ride to the Amboys it was evident that the countryside had been alerted. Factories were deserted, all windows open. The train stopped whenever a blast shook it violently, then crept ahead cautiously.</p>
        <p>When we stopped in Perth Amboy trainmen announced that the train would go no further. When I saw the crowd piling out of the train and rushing for taxis I realized that I was part of a trainload of reporters, cameramen, nurses and doctors.</p>
        <p>We shared the few available taxis, as newspapermen do in such cases, oiling ten or a dozen into and upon each vehicle and never mind what it costs. Baillie had handed me sixty dollars as I ran for the stairs.</p>
        <p>Nobody knew any more about the story we were on than I did. But we soon learned that the explosions were in a large area of meadow outside of South Amboy, known as the town of Morgan, a wartime TNT and shell-loading plant. Almost nobody lived in Morgan, but thousands worked there, department for the safety of the Amboys after working hours. The heavy explosions that rocked Manhattan were sudden disintegrations of large tanks of TNT (tri-nitro-toluol), set off by impact of shells from the scattered shell-loading sheds on the broad meadow. Since wartime secrecy was involved, nobody knew, or pretended to know, how many of these big tanks were in the area, but wise-looking individuals said the worst hadn't even been approached yet. There
        <pb n="369" />was the biggest tank in the world, right in the middle of the devastation, that hadn't been hit. Wait for that!'In Perth Amboy there was such damage as I had not seen except in tornado areas in the West. But it was mostly glass and the crumbling of soft brick into the streets. Walking was the preferred mode of progress, and you walked in the middle of the street.</p>
        <p>We who carried impressive credentials got into South Amboy, where the town was being tossed into the streets with each good blest. Red Cross ambulances were being policed across the military lines into the Morgan area, so I hopped aboard one of these when it stopped while police removed wreckage ahead of it.</p>
        <p>A handsome, serious-looking man, about ay age, and a woman in Red Cross uniform, were the only occupants of the ambulance. I introduced myself, and the gentleman, whose grave face seemed vaguely familiar, said, "Fancy seeing you here! My name is Hargraves, United Press." This is Mrs. Hargraves, just recently become such. She's a Red Cross volunteer worker, so, when I heard of trouble out here I stole a space in her ambulance, coming in from New York. I haven't communicated with the office yet. But it seems we're about to cover this affair together."We lost Mrs. Hargraves in a bit of a mess soon after getting into the busy area, but the U.P. man and I became fast friends, falling down and standing up together as the earth rocked. That night, and and [sic] next two nights, we slept together, when sleeping was possible, on the ground or in basements of destroyed buildings.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the Amboys I found a telephone office, one story high, that was still partially in operation, though the roof was gone, windows too, and wreckage rather difficult to get through. I took
        <pb n="370" />the place of an operator who had a line to New York, and told my story to a rewrite man at U.P. When possible, I returned to this station, and the same girl gave me her seat and head-phones. Hugh Baillie came on to tell me that my story was being by-lined on the wire, throughout the country. I was not thrilled. I told Hargraves that a ten dollar raise would suit me better.</p>
        <p>I confided to Hargraves that I was to be married October 8, and asked him to nudge me awake in time to meet the train on which my future wife was coming in from Minnesota.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="371" />By the afternoon of October 7, I was done in by lack of sleep, overwork and working in wet clothes, since it had been raining, soaking my partner and myself even while we tried to sleep under the open sky, I didn't ask my office for leave. I said, along with my last bulletin, that I was going back to New York by the next ambulance I could catch.</p>
        <p>At mid-after I started for Manhatan [sic], and reached my room late at night, too tired to undress. I had stood for hours, awaiting a bus when the ambulance broke down, had walked some miles, and got on the wrong train. But now I slept.</p>
        <p>I was called to the telephone at six in the morning.</p>
        <p>"You'll have to go back to the Amboys," said the voice of Legres Baillie. "Hargraves got pneumonia and he's in a hospital in New York. Oh, sorry, he's dead! I didn't know it until just now. How soon can you get out there?""In about two days. I just remembered that I'm getting married today, and Conkle said could have the day off. I don't know whether I'll get married or pneumonia, but I'm going back to bed right now."Sleep was impossible. I had to go to Pennsylvania Station to meet my bride-to-be, from whom I had received a telegram that elected her to membership in the Driscoll family, even if we never got a certificate. Nobody in my family, no matter how widely traveled, has ever learned to send a travel telegram, like this:"Arrive Penn Station, Pennsylvania from Chicago, 11:30 Friday a. m. Train 246, car 37, space 16. Meet you information booth, main concourse."When any relative of mine sends that kind of telegram I'll know he [sic] or she'd arrive New York at noon. I went to work on the problem as a reporter would, except that I phoned my office every half hour, asking
        <pb n="372" />whether my loved one had called. I had taken the precaution to give her the phone number, in case she might get lost or abducted. I knew she was not very city-wise, and was convinced that she was so beautiful that thugs would try to kidnap her upon arrival.</p>
        <p>It was considered a great joke at the office, and when Bill Hawkins guffawed right in my ear I told him it was mighty serious business. Bill said, "Yes, Charlie, but you'll get a laugh out of it twenty years from now." Bill was right, as usual.</p>
        <p>I found the lady, badly travel-worn and not looking at all well, three or four hours after she was due. She had taken the wrong train at Chicago and had sat up all the night because her berth was on the other train.</p>
        <p>We went to the Municipal building, got our license, then to the rectory of St. Patrick's Cathedral, where I had made arrangements for publication of banns two-months earlier. The priest admitted that he had the notice in his announcement book, but he had forgotten to make the required announcement. Also, he had neglected to arrange about the dispensation for the marriage outside the bride's home parish.</p>
        <p>All would be well when the Monsignor woke up. He was the chancellor of the diocese, with authority to grant dispensations. But he could not be disturbed during his afternoon nap.</p>
        <p>We were married in the Lady chapel late in the afternoon, and our wedding trip on the uncompleted Jerome avenue subway took us, with a little uphill walking, to the apartment I had rented. It was bare, except for a drop-leaf table, two chairs, and a mattress, all bought at the one store that paid any attention but we had gas in the gas range.</p>
        <p>We went to the McAlpine hotel for three days, during which time I had new promises of immediate delivery from the merchants and assurance of electrical connection by the company. When we moved into the apartment, with only promises for furniture
        <pb n="372-A" />and light, my bride came down kerflop with a terrific case of the influenza that was decimating the country that fall. For several days and nights I nursed her, and an obliging doctor who served many U.P. families called once a day. He could get no nurse and the hospitals were crowded and dangerous. It was a little discouraging, especially when night came on and no light came on. The office had told me it didn't want me if there was influenza in my home, since the danger of contagion was too great. But on the third day I had a call saying half the stuff was down with the plague and I must return to work.</p>
        <p>My wife was running a high temperature, but I had to leave her, there on the floor, every morning at six o'clock, for work. You may know that the work was not very well done. The patient was so sick that she was rarely sorry for herself, and she hardly knew when I came in and when I left.</p>
        <p>For two weeks I left the unlightcd apartment every morning before dawn, and passed the stacks of rough boxes at the curb, awaiting the trucks that would pick them up and take them to the cemeteries, where steam shovels were digging great trenches for the daily burial of the victims of the worst plague in American history. One evening as I paused at the Italian fruit stand on the corner to get an apple or something to substitute for dinner, the old gentleman in charge of the stand asked about my wife. I broke down while telling him about the situation. He gave me a lamp to light the bedroom. Everything was better after we had this dim light. My bride and I prayed God to bless the fruit vendor. Surely enough, God did, and this merciful Italian became a great power in the green-grocer business in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>It was a month before my wife could walk down and up the two flights of stairs, even with much help. It is not surprising that she
        <pb n="373" />did not like New York very well. The storekeepers in the neighborhood used to aks [sic] me what kind of a foreigner my wife was, because they couldn't understand her. She spoke perfect Minnesota English.</p>
        <p>__________It was obvious that the war was drawing to a close, and Roy Howard went to Europe to be in at the kill. His title of president of U.P. gave him entree where even his top correspondents might have difficulty. He got many interviews, but never learned to write, so the interviews were, without exception, unimportant. He once interviewed the Emperor of Japan, but the piece he sent home was all about the carpet in the audience room and the birds and flowers; not a word from the Emperor.</p>
        <p>Now, as the War to End Wars drew to a close there came Roy's opportunity to shake this solid earth, and he shook the wits out of it. On November 7, shortly after the clocks struck twelve noon, came a flash to the cable desk. High Baillie, rising to his full height, held up his right hand and shouted, "Flash!" That automatically stopped all sending wires in the room, and Baillie read the three lines, beginning, "The war is over." It was signed by none less than the Great Howard Himself, and came from the port of Brest. It told of the signing of an armistice.</p>
        <p>Baillie came like a visitation from hell into our little cubicle, shouting, pounding, his hair down in his eyes. "Go out into the saloons and Perry's drug store and round up the telegraphers! They're at lunch and drinking beer! No more beer today! Spread the word: the war is over!" Several. staff members went with me as I rushed down the stairs and into the barrooms, shouting, "Any U.P. telegraphers here? Report at once! The war is over!"Sullenly the wire men left their beers in twos and threes and
        <pb n="374" />marched back to work.</p>
        <p>The word had gone to our two New York clients, the Evening World and the Evening Sun. Extras were rolling. The bell in City Hall cupola began ringing wildly, and out of all the tall and short buildings in the vast area within sound of that bell the crowds came rushing. Church bells were ringing, and total strangers were kissing each other in the streets, while saloons were so crowded that it was impossible to collect from most of the customers.</p>
        <p>That was a day of madness never equalled [sic] in the history of New York, before or since. The Evening Sun and Evening World sold extras all afternoon, and late into the night, repeating Rob Roy's dispatch, as there were no details forthcoming. The cable dropped dead after carrying the one dispatch.</p>
        <p>The Globe and the Evening Mail refused to credit the story. They were served by Associated Press, which had no word of the signing of any armistice. Crowds mobbed news stands, burning stacks of Globes and Mails in the streets. They wanted to believe in Howard and Peace.</p>
        <p>By next dawn a great national headache was throbbing, and the central nerve was in the Pulitzer building, third floor. Associated Press openly denied the Howard story, and queries from newspapers all over the country were piling up. We couldn't get any more out of our chief in Brest, but we were beginning to hedge. Long after, Roy explained, and is still explaining, that he had it right out of the horses's [sic] mouth, or Brest, and that when his Paris office cast doubt upon the horse, he sent a kill message, which, however, did not arrive in time to do any good.</p>
        <p>From the exultant and victorious spirit of November 7, we sank,
        <pb n="375" />hour by hour, as the cable told of continued fighting, and the A.P. newspapers reminded the customers that U.P. had killed a pope or two several days before natural, death took place, and was not to be trusted at any time. The Mail and the Globe were especially bitter, and I was assigned the task of communicating an official statement, couched in apologetic tone, to the publisher of the Globe.</p>
        <p>The response was angry, contemptuous, sarcastic. I was told that the Globe would not print any statement in extenuation of the crime against intelligent journalism committed by the most incompetent of all reporters, Roy Howard of Indiana, who had, by some miracle of the devil, become head of a so-called press association.</p>
        <p>Reactions in other cities were equally uncomforting, since the A.P. papers were, in a heavy, dignified manner, taking utmost advantage of the callow blunder its competitor had made.</p>
        <p>Vice-president Bill Hawkins took the brunt of the abuse. He answered every condemning telegram. He was on the telephone, talking across all the miles, for days and nights. He brought pajamas and blankets from his home in Dobbs Ferry, and spent the nights in the office, close to telephones and sending instruments. He showed signs of wear, and ate lunches brought up from Perry's drug store, while answering the mountains of complaints. We all felt sorry for Bill, and our respect for him increased by the hour.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, Hawkins, red-eyed, drawn, nervous and almost defected, called the staff together. He gave us a short talk, to this effect: "Roy Howard is coming home tomorrow. Undoubtedly he is as much hurt by this incident as any of us, but more so. Let us give him a cordial welcome, as if nothing had happened. I hope all of you will be careful to avoid hurting his feelings by making a joke
        <pb n="376" />of the tragedy, for which we are sure he is not responsible. No matter how you feel, smile and be friendly."Next day, sure enough, Roy came home. When he entered the office he was twirling his stick, laughing and howling, taking the salute like a hero home from the wars. He thought it was the greatest joke of all time. He issued statements right, left and straight up, was interviewed by angry representatives of hoodwinked newspapers, and came out of it all the sane light-hearted, care-free, smiling Rob Roy.</p>
        <p>Hawkins went home to bed with a nervous breakdown, and I've always thought his health was permanently impaired by those scorching days following the Fake Armistice.</p>
        <p>Meantime the real armistice had come and gone. It was a roaring anti-climax in New York and many other cities, where the real celebration had burst forth spontaneously on the seventh. I was assigned to do a color story for the wire, and rode the top deck of a Fifth avenue bus as far as the bus could edge its way through the mobs, now in a less gentle mood than a few days before. There was a great deal of rowdyism and rough work, and many clothes were torn from areas commonly supposed to be clothed in public.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="IV.">
        <p>"You've learned all you can learn from the mail service job," said Conkle one day. "Next week they're going to give you a whirl at the late afternoon sports wire.""Sports?" I gasped. "That's a job I don't do. I know nothing whatever about any kind of sports.""Well, this doesn't require much. You know how to keep a box score, don't you?""No; I haven't the slightest idea of what a box score is.""This job is just handling the baseball and racing wires. You edit the stuff that comes in, keep box scores, which you send out from tine to time, and keep the stuff down for different circuits.""Conkle," I said, "I'm good at the job I'm now doing, and willing to take on extra work. But for God's sake, no sports. I never saw a baseball game in my life, know nothing about racehorses, and have never even read a sports report of any kind in the newspapers." There was some talk between Conkle and Howard and among the other bosses. Ed Hamilton, who was sports editor, heard me say when he was explaining baseball to me, that I could not do the job. Being a natural trouble-maker, with no regard for truth, he told the bosses that I had said I wouldn't take the assignment. Not long afterward Hamilton was fired out of hand for faking an interview with a champion prizefighter and getting caught by a client paper in Arkansas, where the fighter was staying at that time. When this happened I was not among the mourners, but just now Hamilton had me in a spot. I had to take on that sports wire.</p>
        <p>Conkle advised me to buy a Spalding's Guide and study it. I did. I nearly went blind trying to read it in the dark subway. I made nothing
        <pb n="378" />of it except for the information that some bruiser knocked another bruiser down in 1889, and this seemed to me to be or slight import.</p>
        <p>The terrible day came, and I was confronted with batteries of telegraph machines and printers, all chattering away about things that were much more foreign than Greek to me. I sent out the box score when I got one, with never a change, until I was caught at it and told that the box scores changed from hour to hour, and I should edit them to conform. Very well, I edited the next one.</p>
        <p>Baillie came over to me, and, with a kindly though cynical expression, asked me why I had cut the errors out of the scores of the New York team. Two clients had complained.</p>
        <p>I said, "I didn't think it was important to report, every little error made by the home team." Baillie stored incredulously [sic], and I said, in my embarrassment, "Well, suppose somebody reported all our mistakes at the end of every day. Where do you think you and I would be?"Baillie merely retorted, "I know where you'd be, and I think that's where you're going to be. Out in the street," He walked slowly toward Roy Howard's office. Baillie liked me, and he knew the attempt to make a sports editor out of me would end dismally.</p>
        <p>My next offense was the editing of what I considered an ignorant typographical or grammatical error in the report.</p>
        <p>In relating the various plays, which to me deemed so much childish hog-wash, it said, "Jones flied to Smith." I changed it to "flew," and fat was in the fire. Our two local clients called up and wanted to know what kind of a damned fool they had on sports now. Hawkins, with Hamilton at his side, came rushing out of his office and stood over me, shouting until his eyes nearly dropped out. I explained to him, almost as a schoolmaster night explain to an idiot, that the
        <pb n="379" />preterite of fly is flew, and certainly not flied. I offered to find it for him in the dictionary.</p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ!" yelled Hawkins, and "Christ Almighty!" shouted Haward, who had joined the band of distinguished journalists now staring at me. Then they went into a huddle.</p>
        <p>Next day, warned that I must let flied stand, I tackled the ponies. This was worse. There was first a long list of horses marked "Scratched." I let this go by a few times, then threw away the reports on scratches, and finally sent a short sentence saying that the rest of the horses were so badly scratched while running through a blackberry patch that they had to be retired from the race. I wanted to make the report interesting. Only some small clients got that report, and when they complained, Hamilton asked me why I did it. I said I knew the owners wouldn't be such fools as to get their horses mixed up on barbed wire, so I naturally gave the briar explanation.</p>
        <p>I lasted one more afternoon, under rather close supervision. When the phrase "had no excuse" Kept coming up in the report, it got monotonous, so I wrote it out, "War Machine was inexcusable in the bad showing he made."I got in one more before I was sent home that day. The report said Whirlwind Choice was left at the post. I explained that this remarkable horse was unable to take part in the race because his jockey left him tied to the starting post while he went to get a drink in a neighboring saloon.</p>
        <p>Ed Conkle was alone in our cubbyhole when I entered, at the end of the almost endless day. He was laughing so hard that tears were running down his red cheeks, and howling with the pain of such severe
        <pb n="380" />laughing spasms. I was pale and worn. There was nothing funny in the world, so far as I could see. Conkle tried to hide the copy he had been reading, but I observed that it was a handful of the late sports.</p>
        <p>"For Christ's sake, Driscoll, where did you get this one?" he asked. He pointed to a complaint, just in from a Western client. It quoted my race sheet as saying that two horses stretched their muscles so badly in a tight race that they dropped dead of heart disease.</p>
        <p>"Well, they told me to edit this stuff, and I tried to put some sense into it. That report said that two certain horses died in the stretch, and I thought the customers were entitled to some details."Conkle went whooping to Bickel's office to share the joy. I was told to go home, and not bother to report for sports duty tomorrow. I could continue with the Red Letter for the present.</p>
        <p>It must have been hilarious confusion for the wires while it lasted. Next day apologies went out to papers, and a sports man was put on the sports wires.</p>
        <p>I had a feeling that my days with U.P. were numbered, though I was doing good work on assignments. When the victorious fleet came home from the war, I went out on the President's yacht "Mayflower," to greet the victors, witness the bestowal of decorations and promotions. I picked up a lot of human interest that more experienced man (just three correspondents were permitted aboard ship, representing the three press associations) passed up for official releases.</p>
        <p>I was impressed by the discipline of the naval officers who stepped aboard smartly and marched directly to the wardroom, without even a glance at the wives they had not seen for years, some of whom held aloft babies whose naval fathers had never seen then. The first duty of the returned heroes was to report to their Chief, and neither wife
        <pb n="381" />nor child nor mother counted until that ceremony was accomplished. I stressed this in my report, and gave names, with names of babies, too. I was commended for the "color" in my writing, but I knew the bosses hadn't forgotten that sports debacle, and now some of the old reporters would be coming home from service.</p>
        <p>Soon after I arrived for standby duty at the office on the cold and dreary morning of the sixth of January, 1919, I heard Baillie's voice in the news room, tense with genuine Baillie excitement, shout "Flash!"Upon the instant stoppage of every clattering printer and Morse telegraph came the voice again: "Theodore Roosevelt died in his sleep, about midnight, at his home in Oyster Bay." I remember that he mispronounced the first syllable of the name, to rhyme with goose, a common error, then as now.</p>
        <p>The clatter burst upon the confined air again with mighty impetus, as every sender put the flash on every wire, stirring newspaper presses all over the land into action, I was already putting on coat and hat when Baillie appeared at the cubbyhole door, face flushed, and shouted, "Get out to Oyster Bay! Get a statement from the family arid phone it at once! We're waiting for you!"I got an outgoing Long Island Rail Road train, which, I observed, was packed with nervous young men and women, some silent and withdrawn, others chattering and excited. When we piled out at the Oyster Bay station where [sic] were six cabs waiting, and every one was filled with at least seven inside and two on the running boards. I became acquainted with the other reporters and correspondents, cameramen, sketchers and editorialists in and about our cab. Mostly top assignment men, to whom, such an assignment was a tonic.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="382" />A few weeks earlier I had interviewed Teddy, who had a midtown office labeled "Kansas City Star," and was writing a syndicated daily attack upon Woodrow Wilson's war policies. He was making of himself a scourge upon the Democratic administration, building himself up as the obvious candidate of the Republicans in the coming campaign for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Only a few days ago I had covered an address by Roosevelt in Carnegie Hall, to an audience composed mostly of Negroes. The speech was a preliminary vote-getting skyrocket. So I now realized that I had covered the last interview and the last public speech of the great Teddy, whom I did not admire from a political viewpoint, because I was a fanatical follower of Wilson and his League of Nations idealism.</p>
        <p>When we piled out of the cabs on the spacious lawn of Sagamore Hill, there was a hurried caucus, and the three press association men were asked to step forward. A messenger from the house had come out and announced that only one newspaper representative would be admitted. Press association men outrank newspaper reporters on such occasions, and I was chosen as the spokesman, probably, because nobody knew anything about me.</p>
        <p>There was a heavy atmosphere of shock, and dignified mourning in the big reception room. Theodore Junior was spokesman for the family. He answered all my questions about the circumstances of the death, and a secretary and political press agent were at hand to verify answers, as was a Negro servant. I made no notes, returned to the straining group of news folk, gave the substance of the statement, the questions and answers, and answered the queries of the reporters.</p>
        <p>Then we made a dash for the cabs. Telephones were scarce. Young Teddy had told me of one only a short distance down the road, and there
        <pb n="383" />we stopped our cab, routed out the storekeeper, and took turns at the phone. My instructions were to get a hotel room, remain for the funeral, and keep in touch.</p>
        <p>In the time intervening between death and burial, I roamed the little shore town, interviewed everybody who had known or served Mr. Teddy. I talked to the minister of Christ Church, Rev. Dr. George E. Talmage, who, I learned, was a close relative of the late famous Rev. Dr. T. Dewitt Talmage, whose sermons, "Under My Study Lamp," had been a regular feature of the Ladies Home Journal in my boyhood.</p>
        <p>The press agent, who had expected to go through the next political campaign with Roosevelt and land a soft job as presidential secretary for his old age, became violently drunk. the morning after the passing of the Rough Rider, and regained that way until long after the funeral. I am not sure that he ever sobered up. He was belligerent toward the correspondents throughout the tense days, and, in self-defense bawled, "'What do you expect me to do, purr?" "Can't you see that my damned job is dead?"When the last shovelful of earth was tossed upon the heavy grave vault, we all turned homeward, somewhat depressed, and wrote our impressions for the Sunday sections. My work was duly praised by Baillie, which was all that I hoped for.</p>
        <p>The George Martins had dinner with us occasionally, and we with them. George mentioned, from time to time, that I was destined for a place in his organization, but I was becoming impatient. I was afraid I'd be fired one of these days, and then would be in no position to take a better job.</p>
        <p>My wife and I talked the situation over when we had any time for talking. We were net quite making ends meet at hone. Income wasn't
        <pb n="384" />up to expenses. We were using up, very slowly but surely, the little capital we had at the time of our marriage.</p>
        <p>I was most strict with myself on expenditures, and took my lunches, still limited to a quarter a day, at the Automat. Neither of us bought clothes, until it became necessary for me to buy a winter suit. It cost forty dollars, and made a terrible hole in our bank account. But I made a worse hole in my new pants, on the afternoon of my first wearing of the new suit.</p>
        <p>We went for a walk among the rocks on the Manhattan side of the Harlem river on a sunny Sunday afternoon. I slipped on a round rock, fell on my Johnny Lynch knee, and tore the knee right out of my new pants. I cried with chagrin, almost despair, for we could not afford such extravagant accidents. My gentle young wife may have cried quietly as she surveyed the ruin next day, but she told me bravely that she knew a good tailor who could fix it. The tear was patched, and I wore the suit more than the normal lifetime of a suit, but everybody knew it was patched. I didn't care. So long as we worked for Roy Howard, I said, I would wear patched clothes and like it --- a little bit.</p>
        <p>On another occasion, about this time, I suffered another monetary loss which seemed serious to our finances, and, again, through my own fault. For a 20-cent meal at the Automat, I presented a five-dollar bill at the cashier's cage. The cashier shelled out change for a dollar, and hesitated, as was (or is) the custom in many New York eating places. I walked away, minus four dollars, which, undoubtedly, the cashier used for a new hat. I discovered my loss at the door, but complaint was fruitless. Millions of dollars a year are thus appropriated by small-job New York cashiers.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="385" />My bride was sympathetic and understanding, though my stupidities must have made me seem an oaf. She had been accustomed to plenty of new clothes, and it was many months before she felt that she should buy something new in New York. One evening I found her weeping. She confessed that she had spent three dollars for a hat, just because she wanted something new. The hat, she said, was a failure. I made her model it for me. It was a smart green turban, extremely becoming to her. I made a big fuss about it. She changed her mind about its being a flop, and wore it faithfully for as long as we could not afford another three dollars for a hat.</p>
        <p>I told George Martin the story of my sports disaster at the office, and he laughed nearly the whole evening through, tears coming so fast that he almost descended to hysterics. He said that the U.P. could not make a place for me. They wanted fellows whom they could teach to walk a tight rope. Jacobs would make good with them, at least until he should grow up, at about the age of fifty. The prediction proved true. Jacobs became editor of one or more of the problem properties of the Scripps chain, was tossed out at about the age of fifty, and continued with other papers until his death. Jacobs was a good Scripps man, but, as he matured, there was a limit to the amount of tight rope walking [sic] he could do.</p>
        <p>My wife and I were agreed that I could not, in decency, presume upon my friendship with George to force the employment issue. I must say nothing unless in answer to questions, and wait.</p>
        <p>On Sunday afternoons I took my wife on long trips about the fabulous city. For a nickel apiece we could go to the Battery, and for another nickel apiece across the Upper Bay to Staten Island, coming close to the Statue of Liberty on the way. Then for a walk in silent
        <pb n="386" />Wall street, a visit to Old Trinity and St. Paul's, and maybe, if we felt extravagant, a meal at a downtown restaurant.</p>
        <p>I was enamored of the great city. The drama of it fascinated me, and the challenge it held out to a country jake from Kansas was a stimulant. In spare time I searched among the gravestones, read in the Public Library, and strolled through the Bowery, Catherine street, and Greenwich Village. Here, it seemed to me, one might make a home, and friends. Just New York might somehow be a career.</p>
        <p>My wife didn't like the town, and one couldn't blame her. She was only 21, and had never before been away from her parents. She was mightily attached to her mother, and breathlessly awaited the letters from home. Her mother wrote in Swedish, which the daughter could read, though she could not speak the language. I suppose most brides, far from their old hordes, often cry from loneliness. You can't blame them. My wife did her crying while I was at work, never complained of our straitened circumstances, and endured the boredom of cold New York bravely.</p>
        <p>But she talked of a time when, we might move out to the West, and I might be an editor or a writer. She did not feel that she ever could become an integral part of this Babylon.</p>
        <p>As for me, I looked forward to a career in New York. This was good enough for me, if only I could get hold of a little piece of it. I wanted magazine work, looking toward authorship in the distant future. Most of all, I liked to write. Next to that, the sparking of ideas, especially for magazines. Most newspapers were too busy and too prosperous to listen to ideas.</p>
        <p>Could I hope for an editorial job of some sort on the American magazine, one of the Crowell group? Well, George Martin thought I
        <pb n="387" />should start on Farm &amp; Fireside, of which he was not editor, and perhaps work into the American side. All right with me. But, in my own mind kept rising the question, when? There came a telegram from Marcellus Murdock, Wichita, asking whether I would consider an offer of a job as editor of the Eagle. My wife hailed this as an opportunity sent from on high. She liked my people in Kansas, from what she had heard of them, and would enjoy living in a small town, among friends. I took it a little more soberly, because it would mean goodbye to New York, for the immediate future at least.</p>
        <p>We agreed that we should not talk to George about it, because it night seem like forcing his hand.</p>
        <p>So I answered that I would consider any proposition. Followed a telegram inviting me to visit Victor Murdock in Washington, to discuss the possible change.</p>
        <p>My wife went with me to Washington, her first visit to that town and her first trip since our marriage. My interview with Victor, then serving a lame duck term as member of the Federal Trade Commission, was altogether satisfactory. Victor had been a congressman from Kansas, and one of the leaders of the Insurgent movement which disrupted the Republican party, spawned the Bull Moose, and hurrayed Theodore Roosevelt on to defeat as leader of the third party. Victor, who, with his brother Marcellus and his sister Pearl, now owned the Eagle (inherited from their frontier publisher father, Marsh Murdock), had run for the senate on the Progressive ticket after Roosevelt had deserted the cause for reasons of political expediency, and had been defeated. Victor sulked in his tent for the rest of a long like, and was fortunate in being able to do most of his sulking in a bureau job
        <pb n="388" />in Washington. He had never been very active in management of the newspaper at home, but sometimes made an appearance, such as the elder James Gordon Bennett used to make to his Herald in New York. He gradually became a pale legend to the home folk.</p>
        <p>Victor had a brilliant and not well organized mind. He could not write any better than his distinguished father, but sometimes tried. He was considerably left of center, as was I, in national politics. In two days of consultations there was a meeting of minds, and I engaged to show up for duty in Wichita on March 1, 1919, about a month from the time of the interview.</p>
        <p>Victor promised me unhindered control of policy on the paper. He had more confidence in me than I had any right to expect of one who knew so little about my equipment for such a job. The Eagle was, at this time, one of the most powerful papers in the Mississippi Valley. After the agreement was sealed by letters on both sides, I told George Martin about it. He was sad, embarrassed and somewhat out of countenance. He asked why I had not told him of the Wichita offer, and I told him the truth. I said that I had not wished to hold over him the whip of a competitive offer, and had not wished to presume upon his friendship. George understood, being a sensitive person. But he was sorry, and not sure that I was wise in leaving New York at a time when opportunity there was opening for me. I said that I must be about the business of feeding my bride and getting together some chairs and tables, and so would be off for the prairie.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="In the light of many more years of experience, I think I should have been less sensitive about the matter, and should have told George of my offer in the West. But experience is what we get by living, and I had not lived enough. 389" />The Eagle agreed to pay for shipment of our furniture, not a great bill, and whatever household goods we wished to take with us. We took practically everything. Most of the furniture was of good quality. We started out with the idea of buying only the best, but buying little. Some of that furniture we have in our home today, as good as the day we bought it, and worth more then we paid for it.</p>
        <p>As the train pulled out cf New York I turned and looked through the window at the towers and massive structures. "Goodbye New York," I said. "We'll be back!"

      <div type="chapter" n="V">
        <p>Thinking she needed encouragement about leaving New York for the West, I had told my wife how she would enjoy the spring climate in Kansas. The peach trees would be in bloom. The sun would be shining, green crops waving upon the undulating hills, apple trees bursting into bud. I described the burden of locust trees, with perfume penetrating the Valley, mile on mile. She said, "I know I'm going to like it, and your people, too. They wrote me such nice letters."We rode into the station in Wichita in one of the worst blizzards in the history of Kansas. Snow was up to your elbows in many parts of town. A great wind came roaring out of the north, and we were chilled.</p>
        <p>"This is very unusual," was all I had to say.</p>
        <p>Members of my family met us, and we spent that night in the modest cottage of my sister Margaret's large family. There was no central heat, and we nearly froze to death that night. But everybody was cordial and enthusiastic in welcome.</p>
        <p>"You know, Mother always said you would come back to be editor of the Eagle some day. She said so when you were a carrier." My sisters reminded me.</p>
        <p>Yes, and I began to wonder how much of the motivation that had brought me back to the West was due to that prediction of my mother, plus the Horatio Alger story. I was to be editor of the paper on which I had worked at four dollars a week as a student.</p>
        <p>The blizzard delayed our finding a place to live until the last day of February, when we took a furnished apartment in a frame building on South Lawrence avenue. It wasn't much of a home, but it night do until our furniture arrived by freight. We were comforted by the news that New York had been hit much harder by the blizzard than we had been.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="391" />Trolley traffic had been brought to a complete standstill, and the big town was busy for several weeks, digging out of the snowbanks. This was the historic blizzard that set the inventors to work, designing the snow-eaters and other equipment that make blizzards a pleasure today in New York and a few other cities.</p>
        <p>My wife and sister Marie were fast friends from the first day. They had a great mutual respect, with never a break in the pleasant relationship until Marie's death, many years later. Likewise Marie's two daughters and one son became familiars and friends. Margaret, who had, all her life, taken a different view of everything and everybody, was more reserved, probably because my wife was of Swedish parentage. With Marie, her brother's wife was accepted as a sister at once. With Margaret, she was on trial, and never quite right. Margaret's numerous children were also on the tentative side of friendship, but always polite.</p>
        <p>Tom Kennedy, Margaret's husband, came to our apartment during the first few days of our residence, and told me with genuine pride that he, as Grand Knight of the local lodge of the Knights of Columbus, had arranged for my initiation into the order.</p>
        <p>My answer was so completely unexpected that it gave poor Tom a shock from which he never recovered. I thanked him for his solicitude, and said that I was not a believer in secret societies of any sort, had never joined one, and never would. I explained, that it seemed to me that the building up of secrets, hand-grips, symbols and grand images or titles made up a childish or adolescent mass of stuff that was thin pabulum for a grown man. I acknowledged that I might be wrong, and that the Knights of Columbus or of Pythias, or the Masons might have discovered some wonderful fundamental truths that the rest of the world
        <pb n="392" />did not know, but that, if they had done this and failed to publish their secret knowledge to the world, for the good of mankind, as doctors are supposed to do, they were no better than they should be.</p>
        <p>Tom, who considered the K. of C. next to the Catholic church as a depository of truth, could not understand such an attitude. He was terribly embarrassed, as he had promised his brother Knights that he would produce the news editor of the Eagle for member ship in jig time.</p>
        <p>Marcellus Burdock welcomed me to the Eagle. He was now 36 years old, red-haired, with an unmistakably Scottish type of face and head, a little under medium height, and full of energy. He inquired about my wife, and immediately invited us to his College Hill home for dinner at an early date.</p>
        <p>I found the same old Eagle, complacent, money-making, but slowly losing ground to the Beacon. The staff, from Marcellus down to the oil reporter, Kent Eubank, was entirely amateur in the sense that none had ever had experience on a real city newspaper; indeed, perhaps none had over worked on any other newspaper. Standard editorial practice was unknown, and the use of English was deplorable.</p>
        <p>My old friend and first boss, Sidney Long was missing. He had gone insane on the job, and had to be confined until his death. During the influenza epidemic Sidney worried about everybody's health. One day he gave orders that twenty small stoves be installed in the business office, without stovepipes or outlets. As the stoves were being delivered, Marcellus asked about the project in hand. Sidney, smiling pahhily [sic], explained that he was going to fill the stoves with horse manure and set them alight.</p>
        <p>"Then, you see," he said, condescendingly, "the girls won't be able to come to work any more, because the stuff shells awful. They
        <pb n="393" />won't be in such danger of getting the flu if they stay at home. The men can stand it, and we can carry on through a little smoke all right."So they put a strait-jacket en the old fellow and put him away. I missed him and his loud shouting.</p>
        <p>Burt Doze, who had been city editor when I broke in as a reporter, was now managing editor. Hs was getting on for middle age, fat, sailing, good-natured, but wholly incompetent to hold down an important newspaper job.</p>
        <p>There was a small staff in the editorial department, possibly seven or eight, counting the women, all of whom were inexperienced in newspaper work, and mostly interested in something else, such as getting a husband or getting rid of one. Doze did nearly all of the copyreading and head-writing, though there was a city editor of sorts, who seemed to be embarrassed by his lack of knowledge about everything.</p>
        <p>One reporter, an amateur ladies' man, who had no ability, but was irrevocable because of relationship ties within the office, caused a good deal of trouble by his unwillingness to work and his semi-idiotic tendency to "play games" with the female reporters.</p>
        <p>When he had become such a nuisance that he was almost unbearable, this Handsome Joe was summarily removed from our midst by the police, who bore a warrant charging him with a most heinous offense against the infant daughter of a rich oil man. Office influence got him out of jail on bail, which he promptly jumped, fleeing to Texas. There he got a newspaper job, but the proprietors heard about the Wichita crime and, after investigation, fired him. He headed east, and, with connivance of Wichita connections, sank into the oblivion of a minor newspaper job in Washington.

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="VI">
        <p>My term of service as editor of the Eagle lasted five years, almost to a day. It was evident to me from the beginning that I should not count upon a career here, but, largely through lethargy, I stayed on three years longer than I should have stayed. Two years in such a job right have been good experience at my age and condition of life. I learned to handle several jobs at a time, to write 2,000 words a day the year around, original editorial material, and to deal with all manner of people furnished by that clime and time. But I could have learned all that in two years. The other three were thrown away; so much boredom, overwork and disillusionment.</p>
        <p>During the five years our two daughters were born, I got one increase in salary, and I had a variegated experience. Good conversation was hard to come by, and I missed it more than any other factor of civilized living.</p>
        <p>Joining with a Congregational minister, one Hubert C. Herring, and the president of the Quaker college, I helped organize a small discussion club called Hammer &amp; Tongs. As long as it held to its original program of inviting for membership only talkable, tolerant and literate men, this club remained the most stimulating intellectual group in the city, though its membership was limited to thirty. The original membership of the club, together with early additions, were men accustomed to give and take in exchanges of opinion. Eventually bankers and politicians infiltrated, and the character of the organization became much the same as that of the local Rotary club.</p>
        <p>I carried on simultaneous campaigns against the KuKlux Klan, the Kansas Gas &amp; Electric company, street car company and the police department. It was fun, in a way, but not too safe. Also, I developed a duodenal ulcer that nearly did me in. This, the most widely recognized
        <pb n="395" />of editorial occupational diseases, hit me hard in the height of my campaign to clean up the police department, which was rank with corruption and packed with oafs who made no effort to capture bandits or murderers, but scoured the town all night for couples that might be making love in parked automobiles.</p>
        <p>As was traditional in Wichita, robbers of all grades were given sanctuary in the town, with the understanding that they would keep the town itself free of crime. The underworld boss, at this period one Eddie Adams, walked the street by day, and no cop dared molest hire. How much this cost him and his cohorts in cash, we never learned, but we found out plenty.</p>
        <p>We had, early in my editorship, an efficient chief of police who made a great reputation throughout the United States for his training of cops, management of traffic, and discipline, but he was fired when the City Hall gang heard a baseless rumor that he and I had gone to school together in the East. The Chief was a graduate of Harvard.</p>
        <p>This chief was succeeded by one who could not sign his name; a superannuated patrolman who had one foot in the grave. A dumb-slicker type of cop from Kansas City was made chief of detectives, and actually usurped, with City Hall connivance, the duties and authority of chief of police.</p>
        <p>Under this presumptuous bandit-protector, our cops went trigger mad.</p>
        <p>They shot a respectable lady through the back, because a man in the car in which she was riding had his arm around her. They shot a man in Riverside park for parking wrong. They shot to death a sleepwalker, who was running naked through the snow. They gave the usual explanation: "He reached for his hip pocket and we thought he was armed." They arrested a traveling salesman from Cincinnati for dancing
        <pb n="396" />incorrectly at a public dance hall, and the salesman turned the tables. He shot the cop dead.</p>
        <p>In the heat of their frenzy, they shot one of Eddie Adams's men, mistaking him for a law-abiding citizen. Then the war was on. During the next few days cops and robbers shot it out; many on each side being killed or wounded while the pedestrian public walked in fear through the fusilades. Eddie Adams was one of the victims.</p>
        <p>Naturally, I played up all of this massacre business in criticizing the police-and-gang divided rule of the city.</p>
        <p>To get rid of me, agents of the City Manager, who had accepted his job as a vantage post for putting over a profitable deal for the water company, went to Omaha, arranged with the police chief there to rig up false police records against me, dating back to the time of my reportorial days in Omaha, and also arranged to employ an Omaha gunman to kill me. They promised to put a police uniform on him, have him lie in wait for me as I walked home, in an unlighted street, after putting the morning paper to bed, and shoot me as a suspected criminal.</p>
        <p>One of the telegrams from the Wichita police crooks to the Omaha chief was stolen off the chief's desk by a friend of mine (Nice to have friends when you need them!) and promptly rewired to me.</p>
        <p>I had the telegram photostated, copies sealed, in half a dozen safes of friends, and went directly to the office of the butter-sweet City Manager, laid a copy on his desk, watched while he turned white and shook, and then dared him to have me murdered or framed, as was planned.</p>
        <p>The City Hall gang, nearly all the members of which were prominent Sunday School men, gave up the murder plot. They never learned how I tapped their correspondence with the Omaha criminals.</p>
        <p>__________
        <pb n="397" />The battles against inadequate services and overcharges of the electric and gas company and the mixture of bad salt water and foul politics of the water company went on with varying results; some for both sides.</p>
        <p>Being now in a Don Quizote [sic] mood, I went after the ice company for its universal practice of shorting its household customers in weight of ice, a fraud that was taking hundreds of thousands of dollars a year out of the pockets of customers. In those days before the electric refrigerator, ice was delivered, house to house, in a horse-drawn wagon that started out from the factory filled with cakes weighing one hundred pounds each. In the blazing sun that brought temperatures in the shade beyond a hundred degrees, day after day, the icemen were supposed to get a hundred pounds out of each of those cakes, even if they had melted down to fifty.</p>
        <p>I started weighing, on tested scales, ice delivered at our house, and found an average of a third of the ice missing, over a month's time. Publishing this, I got hundreds of citizens into the habit of weighing their ice, and there was a revolt against the fraud. We won that battle, partly, and for a brief interlude, about as a victorious nation wins a war.</p>
        <p>__________Van came down from Kansas City to visit us, soon after we had established ourselves in the five-room cottage at 114 North Estelle avenue, where the many trees and missing street lights made a tempting setting for the murder the associated gangsters of Omaha and Wichita never carried out. Van was prosperous now, getting on nicely in his own office in the heart of the Kansas City business area, and was in a highly jolly mood. He had no children, but was immediately
        <pb n="398" />fond of our little daughter, and brought toys and treasures which she worshipped because they came from the hands of high-spirited, laughing Uncle Van. Van was drunk only once during this visit, which lasted a week. On a sunny day he found himself at Tom Kennedy's welding shop with a bottle of bourbon in his coat pocket. He and Tom, who was strictly forbidden by his wife ever to take a drink, finished that bottle, and later, by some combination of events that were vague in Van's mind, were at the Lassen hotel with a stranger and an old friend or two, drinking up other bottles.</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon, Van took Tom to his hone, in a condition that caused consternation, weeping and praying at that quietly intolerant institution, where liquor and the Devil were as one. Van then came on to our house, entered laughing, and, somewhat disconnectedly, related the events of the day. He thought it an excellent thing that our Prohibitionist sister should have a little shock, and said Tom should do it at least once a year.</p>
        <p>But Van had a serious and determined air when he announced that he was now, at last, going to force John to sell the farm and recognize the rights of the other members of the family. He waited for the right day, visited the farm, expressed his chagrin at its dilapidated condition, and told John quietly that the farm would have to be sold and a settlement made, right away.</p>
        <p>John received this ultimatum with perturbation, but, at first, with some self-assurance. He told Van that the farm was his in fee simple, that the deed was in his name, and that he purposed to keep all the proceeds when and under whatever conditions a sale was made.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="399" />Van hardened in his attitude, spoke plainly, told John that the family already had been robbed of its rights for years by reason of the selfishness of the eldest brother, and said that he would now proceed legally, and things would have to take their course in the court of equity. He admitted that he had some other plays up his sleeve, and would use then if forced to do so. There was no loud talk or hysteria, such as characterize so many family quarrels. Van was sure of his ground and spoke rather as attorney for the living heirs, then as a litigant.</p>
        <p>Pat Whaley, meantime, had succeeded in cheating Marie out of all of her father's estate except the three-room house, which he and one of his crooked cronies tried to take from her. Pat admitted that he owed Big Flurry's estate a considerable sum of money, and that he had no proper accounts. But he said he would pay all eventually.</p>
        <p>Upon urging by Van and me, Marie, meeting Pat in the lobby of the Beacon building by chance, asked when he was going to pay what he owed her. The white-haired old thief told her he would pay her one day soon. Marie suggested that there should be some record of the debt because, after all, life is uncertain. He just laughed at this and said he'd be around. He died that night! Naturally, there was no way of forcing a settlement from the Whaley estate.</p>
        <p>Van went back to Kansas City because of urgent legal matters there, but promised to return and make an end of the farm problem soon.</p>
        <p>He was back in a month. He had joined forces with a strong firm in Kansas City, and had quit drinking, was making money, and was in excellent health. He stayed with us, but sought out John at once, and presented an ultimatum that was backed by a definite plan of action.</p>
        <p>John must put the farm actively on the market within ten days, sell it in the boom market then prevailing, and divide the proceeds
        <pb n="400" />according to the unwritten trust Mother had made when she signed the property, against advice of counsel, over to John.</p>
        <p>John went to some length to explain that, because of his great sacrifice in giving up his professorial penmanship career in order to "save the farm," he should be rewarded by having the property as a gift, from Mother and the "others," as he always called his brothers and sisters collectively. This argument made Van see red, and he centered his ridicule and bitter retorts upon John's mispronunciation of sacrifice as "sacrafuss." Van summed up the case thus: John never had made a living out of professoring, but always had help from Mother. Since coming to the farm he had lived well, and since the departure of the younger boys had done no work, raised no crops, but lived in idleness, eating up our property with added real and chattel mortgages. When a week of peaceful negotiation got him nowhere, Van announced calmly that he was going back to Kansas City on a Friday, would prepare his papers, and would return to Wichita the following Tuesday. He would then file suit, either in the name of the brothers and sisters, or in his own name, for an accounting of the trust, for rent for the elapsed time, for damages accruing from John's neglect of the property, and to force sale of the real and personal property wrongfully held by John. He would insist that the proceeds of the sale of the farm be placed in custody of the court, to be divided, share and share alike, John's share to be subject to any judgments rendered against him, and to the deduction of the mortgages John had taken against the land and personal property without consulting the other parties at interest.</p>
        <p>As a final persuader, Van said he would swear out a warrant charging John with fraud and with larceny as bailee, and would have him in jail before the weekend.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="401" />Under this onslaught, John broke. He promised to sell at once. Van returned the following week, personally visited the real estate agent John had picked, explained the situation to him, and delivered to him warning in writing that the sale was to be approved by all members of the family and the proceeds paid in separate checks to each of them.</p>
        <p>John now began to show signs of mental imbalance. He worried himself into a fever, suffered from high blood pressure, and talked more and more irresponsibly. A client had been found readily, and John spent much of his time, daily, in the stuffy office of the real estate man, a slicker from the neighboring farmlands who talked like a hillbilly but knew how to swing a deal to his own advantage.</p>
        <p>John attributed his mental aberration, which he recognized as such, to some kind of dope which, he said, the realtor was putting in the drinking water with which he plied the prospective seller. I accompanied John to the slicker's office one afternoon, when John was indulging in a good deal of meaningless talk, and observed that the slicker did bring to John a great many cups of water, which the patient eagerly swallowed. However, I took a few quaffs and had no ill results.</p>
        <p>As the deal finally progressed to consummation, Marie, Margaret and I, sorry for Poor John as always, induced Van to agree that John should have half of the sale price, after the mortgagee had been deducted fom [sic] the common fund, and that the other half should be divided among the other brothers and sisters, share and share alike. Reluctantly, Van agreed.</p>
        <p>In about two weeks, the deal was consummated, the farm sold for cash, and the separate checks distributed. Meanwhile John's mental condition grew steadily worse, and he became a victim of delusions and a persecution mania. He came to my editorial office frequently,
        <pb n="402" />extremely excited and red in the face. He talked loudly and pointlessly. I persuaded him to go to the family doctor, who reported the obvious facts that John was confused in his mind and had high blood pressure. He thought the patient might recover with rest and a change of scene.</p>
        <p>After the settlement came the breakup at the farm. This occupied a few weeks, during which John sold most of the tools, implements and furniture, such as it was, and, of course, kept the money for himself. I was awarded the family Bible as my share of the loot, and, indeed, that was all I wanted.</p>
        <p>During his days of planning, John had decided to leave the Kansas scene at once and forever. He picked California in the vicinity of Los Angeles for his old age retreat, and said he wanted to forget Kansas. He left by train, after assuring us all that his madness was gone since he had quit drinking the water at the real estate office. One of his last assurances to me was, "I am now John Driscoll The Man." This was reminiscent of the old speeches he used to make up while oiling the harness on rainy days in the granary, and I believed that he was restored to normal mental health.</p>
        <p>On the day Van received his check for his share of the sale price of the estate, he got a pocketful of cash from the bank. At my house he extracted from an inside pocket an old, work notebook. In it he had itemized every loan I ever had made him, from as little as a dime up to a hundred dollars. He added it all up in my presence, asked me to look at the account carefully, and paid me in cash to the last cent. Here, indeed, was an honest man.</p>
        <p>John was fifty-one years old now, without family, right, left or center, to look after or to be responsible to. He had no plans, beyond
        <pb n="403" />going out to the West, looking it over, seeing some old acquaintenances [sic] who had gone out there to retire. His health was good, but he had enough money so that, barring bad fortune, he could be independent without working, and he had no overweening passion for work. He seemed older than does an active man, particularly a business or professional man, at the half-century mark. It seemed right and proper to him that he should take it easy for the rest of his days, and he could contemplate. He was more religious than ever, and received Holy Communion almost every Sunday.</p>
        <p>I regretted that John had never learned to read deeply or for consolation and entertainment. Suppose he had ten or twenty more years, without any physical activity. Would it not be of great benefit to him, since he made friends but seldom, to patronize one of the many excellent public libraries out there, and store up treasures of the mind? John did not look forward greedily to this prospect. He had almost infinite capacity for idleness. Nothing could please him more than to sit in the sun, watch the waves break on the beach, and think about the progressive world in which he lived. As always, his creature comfort demand was slight. He could live inexpensively, and thus perhaps live a long time without feeling the need for doing productive work.</p>
        <p>Marie built the little kitchen the Old Man had planned to build for her. Van bought some furniture for his new offices, and paid some of his debts. The Kennedys bought a home.</p>
        <p>As for my wife and me, we had our second child in April, following the breakup of the old farm, and had plenty of places to put a little extra money.</p>
        <p>Besides, we were thinking of leaving Wichita.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="VII">
        <p>During my five-year stretch as editor in Wichita I made at least two trips each year to "the outside," as prisoners are wont to call everything outside the walls. I was writing regularly for the Baltimore Sun and the Evening Sun, mostly editorial page features about Kansas and the Kansans. I also wrote for The Nation and for half a dozen other publications. When I landed my first Kansas story in Country Gentleman and got a check for five hundred dollars, the largest amount I'd had for an article, I went to the leading jewelry store, run by a fat and serious gentleman, Ed Vail, and bought my wife the engagement ring we had never felt that we could afford. Never until I slipped that ring on her hand as a surprise had I realized that rings, especially certain kinds of rings, are really important to women.</p>
        <p>Vail engaged me in conversation about my eyes, which were giving me much trouble. I suffered from violent pains in my left eye, which I traced directly to the day, some months previously, when my eyes had been examined and vision refracted for glasses by a locally noted oculist. The pain had kept me from sleeping for approximately one month, and at the end of three months of firghtful [sic] pain my hair was rapidly turning gray.</p>
        <p>Recently I had gone back to the oculist for the fourth time since the new glasses had been fitted, and the dapper little doctor told me quite cold-bloodedly that I had a beginning glaucoma in the left eye, stemming from the atropine which his stenographer, disguised as a nurse, had put into both my eyes while I waited for the refraction.</p>
        <p>I mention this in some detail here because so many persons are blinded thus by "drops" that are administered without prior diagnosis
        <pb n="405" />by just such stenographers in nurses' uniforms in the waiting rooms of oculists and so-called oculists throughout the world. This is a common cause of blindness which usually comes on during long periods of intense pain. The doctor has the drops dropped in order to paralyze temporarily the nerve controlling the muscle of accommodation, which moves the iris outward and inward as the shutter of a camera is moved for admission of more or less light. When that muscle is paralyzed it is easier for the examining doctor to refract the vision, though he can do it just as well, in a little longer time, without the paralysis, which costs him nothing but often costs the patient his sight, and even, in some cases his reason or his life.</p>
        <p>This doctor, who had the drops (which may be atropine or almost any other datura drug, made from the deadly nightshade or the jimson weed) administered to all patients applying for examination with the possibility of new glasses in prospect, told me that I would be completely blind in the left eye soon, possibly within three months, and that the disease was sure to spread to the other eye, with a maximum of five or six years before total blindness. The stenographers in nurses' uniforms laughed heartily when I turned pale at this information.</p>
        <p>"Yes, we'll have to take the eye out as soon as the pain gets bad enough," said the pleasant little sadist. We'll take both out eventually. That's the only way to relieve the pain. It would drive you crazy."Vail drew this story from me by intelligent questions. Then, with great apparent satisfaction, he said, "Yes, you'll lose both eyes, all right. I have the same disease. Get it the same way. But I'm going regularly to a doctor in Baltimore and Washington; Walter
        <pb n="406" />Wilmer is his name. He's giving me pilocarpin sweats, and he's going to save my eyes. But you couldn't afford that. It costs a great deal of money."He stopped, looked at me closely for my facial reaction, and repeated solemnly, "Yes, a great deal of money. More, by far, than you'll ever have."On my next visit to the quack, who wanted to be about the business of removing the eye, I told him I was going east on my vacation, and would like to have the names of a few good oculists. He wrote down six; five in New York and Baltimore, and one in St. Louis. I went to St. Louis right away, saw Dr. Meyer Wiener, who, after careful examination and much good conversation, told me that I might never lose all of the sight of either eye, and certainly would not have to have the eye removed. He gave me a prescription for a solution of pilocarpin hydrochloride, the same medicine used in the sweating of my comfortable and wealthy jewler, and I've been using it, in weak solution, ever since, only when pain makes it necessary. It is the drop that overcomes the paralysis induced by the Wichita quack. While I have had much eye trouble and plenty of pain in the intervening years, I have been able to read and write many times as much as the average person, thanks to the genial and able Wiener, now in retirement in California.</p>
        <p>On one of the early trips to New York I stopped at Baltimore and called on Henry L. Mencken, at his request. In the course of an afternoon of good conversation in the house on Hollins street, he said he had liked what I had been writing for the Sunpapers, as well as some stuff he had bought from me for the Smart Set, which he and George Jean Nathan were now leaving. He told me of the magazine they were planning, to be called The American Mercury, and we talked at length about what articles I should do for it.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="407" />It was my experience from the beginning of my conversations and correspondence with Mencken that it was better not to talk over articles with him in advance of writing. When that was done, the Article seldom pleased him. It hadn't enough Mencken in it, and, after all, he had put a lot of Mencken into the planning of it. When he finally published my first Mercury piece, about the country banker, it was a mediocre bit, and I wasn't proud of it. Later, I sent him articles without prior consultation, and he accepted them with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="408" />Mencken loved conversation. I didn't drink at that time, or we might have become much faster friends over mugs of beer. But he was interested in my work, and gave me this solemn piece of advice, often repeated through the years: "Write about Kansas and Kansans. That's what you know, and you can express the Kansas spirit better than any of the heavier stuff you like to think and write about. You ought to plan to write the great Kansas novel." I explained that I had little skill in plot structure, and probably never would write a novel. Meantime, we were developing in Wichita a story that was destined to become one of the best continuities in a generation of news of the American scene. One evening the police reporter told me the cops were having great fun beating and badgering a funny little fellow who said he was a Russian prince. Why did they beat him? What had he done against the peace and dignity of the State of Kansas? Well, the cops in Kansas City had beaten and badgered him. Our heroic chief of detectives, who got so much pleasure in the shooting of lovers and sleepwalkers, had come from Kansas City. Whatever they did in that town he thought proper, indeed almost essential, that he should do or have done in Wichita.</p>
        <p>I told the cops they must let the Russian go free unless they had
        <pb n="408" />some charge against him. When I said this in print, they reluctantly turned loose the man who said he was Prince Michael Dimitri Alexandravitch Obelensky Romanoff. But, they said, he had better look out, since they had information from Kansas City that he had sequestered in some undiscovered spot the crown jewels of the imperial family of Russia. They said they had beaten him chiefly to force him to disclose the hiding place of "Them crown jools."The Prince generally used the name Dimitri when not displaying the imperial colors, and said he wished to be known as Michael Dimitri, laborer. He said it didn't matter whether you spelled it with or without the first i. He admitted his royal blood, but did not insist upon its recognition by Americans. Before coming to Wichita, and after the Kansas City beatings, he had been a ditch-digger in one of the Oklahoma oilfields. A flood there had washed him out of a job, and, he said, destroyed nearly all of his personal belongings.</p>
        <p>Mike, as he came to be known throughout the country eventually, said he was born in St. Petersburg in 1893, which would make him forty years old at the time of his appearance in Wichita. He appeared to be about that, or slightly younger.</p>
        <p>He was short, dark, with wavy black hair, a little black mustache, rather close-set dark eyes, heavy eyebrows, prominent lips; weight about a hundred and thirty pounds. He spoke with an English manner, but not at all Oxford man, and by mispronunciations and other errors frequently betrayed lack of formal education. He nevertheless claimed to be a graduate of Eton and Oxford.</p>
        <p>Dimitri spent much time in my office. I found his conversation interesting, and there was dearth of good conversation at that place and time, as I have indicated. I took him to dinner at my home, and
        <pb n="409" />several times bought meals for him in downtown restaurants when he was obviously hungry. 1 befriended him against the police, who were set on to harrass [sic] him by the Beacon, because of the eternal war between the two newspapers. That war was unfortunate for the Prince. Had it not been for the Beacon's determination to discredit him, the police would have ignored his presence in the town after the one beating.</p>
        <p>At first, Mike represented himself to be a Prince Dimitri who was known to the world, and was then living in Paris and London. I looked up this identity item in the Almanack de Gotha, and found many discrepencies [sic], including the item of age. Mike then admitted to me that he was not exactly that prince, but another one, closely related, and said he considered it a point of honor to keep his true identity secret.</p>
        <p>I told him plainly that he was no prince, out that I liked him, sympathized with him in his trouble with the police, and found no evidence of any wrongdoing that called for social condemnation. I said much the same thing in newspaper stories that recorded the Prince's doings in Wichita, but refrained from any public denunciation of his claims to royal blood.</p>
        <p>Mike wore riding clothes most of the time, because they were almost the only clothes he possessed. He was rather conspicuous on the streets of Wichita, after working all day on a pavement-removal gang, strutting along in his leggings, riding breeches, short coat and derby hat. Although small and not physically strong, he kept up fairly well with the gang of Negro laborers with which he worked. Mostly he lifted, with bare hands, the pieces of asphalt that had been cracked up by a machine, and tossed them into a truck. The blocks were hot from the August sun. Mike really earned his living, such as it was.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="410" />Two daughters of a rich lawyer and oil man took him up, went riding with him evenings and Sunday afternoons, and invited him to suppers and teas. The oil lawyer saw in Mike a possible royal son-in-law, and lent him money.</p>
        <p>Now the proprietor of the leading department store, A.W. Kenkel, gave Mike a job as a floorwalker in his store, at twenty-five dollars a week, and installed him as a resident of the Wichita club, most exclusive of the business men's look-how-rich-I-am organizations. Club expenses exceeded the amount of the salary, and Mike frequently was unable to get him laundry, for lack of the service charge. Eventually Henkel loaned the Prince a small amount of pocket money.</p>
        <p>I led Mike up a certain street and stopped at a greengrocer's to buy something for dinner, because I knew that the proprietor was a Russian, and I wanted to test Mike's knowledge of his supposedly native language. I intorduced [sic] the two, but Mike angrily spurned the introduction and walked away. When I asked why, he said, "I wouldn't speak to that dirty mujik! His people killed my people, and are responsible for most of my troubles." That [sic] seemed logical enough.</p>
        <p>About this time newspaper publicity brought letters from Hillsboro, Ill., where Mike had lived as a boy, under the name of Harry Ferguson. Also there were stories that he had arrived there when a small lad, as a waif, farmed out by a New York society for the care of orphans.</p>
        <p>Harry (or Mike) admitted this, and began to make elaborate explanations, which became more and more complicated as time went on and letters came in from many cities. From New York came the story that Prince Dimitri had escaped from Ellis Island Immigration Station on Christmas Day, 1922. He had been deported from England as an undesirable [sic]
        <pb n="411" />alien who claimed Aerican [sic] birth, was unable to prove this nativity to American authorities, and was awaiting further investigation. He slipped out of the detention building at night and, pushing his clothes on an improvised raft ahead of him, swam through the icy water, at least a mile, to the Battery. There he dressed and disappeared.</p>
        <p>Some newspaper, in telling of the wanderings and adventures of Mike, made a typographical error in the headline, using a G instead of an F for Ferguson. Thereafter he was, in newspapers and magazines that do not go in for original research or verification, Harry Gerguson, a name which, according to the best information I have been able to turn up, never was borne by any human being.</p>
        <p>Michael was now occupying the luxurious bachelor apartment of a rich Wichita lumberman, who turned the quarters in exclusive Sedgwick Annex over to the Prince while the Wichitan toured Europe. Mike invited me up to his apartment several time, but explained that he was unable to serve me his host's champagne because he had no funds with which to buy ice.</p>
        <p>One day, at noon, I appeared at Mike's apartment with bad news. Our police reporter had told me that the Wichita police had received a reply to their inquiry on Mike from Scotland Yard. The Beacon would publish the story in the Home edition, and the police would then pick up Mike and beat him some more for his sins in England.</p>
        <p>Mike paced the living room and declaimed, "But this is outrageous and preposterous! I suppose I must be off, else they'll be trying to deport me again. But how shall I go anywhere? I am devoid of funds!"I told the police that I would get Mike out of town if they would let him alone. I told Mike he had better get an early train. He said that if he had a ticket to Chicago he would leave on an evening train.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="412" />We struck a bargain. The Eagle would purchase transportation to Chicago in return for a signed story---the true story---of Mike's life. He would relate the story to me. I would write it, and he would sign it.</p>
        <p>Meantime, the Beacon had appeared with the Scotland Yard picture of Mike as Prisoner 1151, dated July 18, 1921. Said the London report: "He has no claim to the title of Prince, but his correct name name [sic] is not known to the police." There was a list of six convictions, five of which were on charges growing out of misrepresentation of identity, a wartime offense. The sixth was for stealing a dress shirt. On the identity charges he had received sentences ranging from one day to one month, and in one care he was found insane and sentenced to Broadmoor "during His Majesty's pleasure."The Prince explained all of the charges and convictions to me. Five convictions hinged upon his claim that he was Prince Michael, which he could not prove. The dress shirt incident, which got him a sentence of two years, had happened at a London club. Preparing to go to dinner, Mike found that he had no dress shirt, so borrowed one from a friend across the hall. The friend was out at the time of the borrowing, and, like a cad, brought charges. On the final hearing on "breach of recognizances" charges, Mike was sentenced to be deported. This deportation wound up with the escape from Ellis island by swimming.</p>
        <p>All this did not seem serious to me. Summing it up, we had at worst an impostor, and a genial one, who had done no great wrong. The mystery of the cultivated English accent was solved. Mike had picked it up from a great English scholar, linguist and dictionary editor who had been a fellow-prisoner at Broadmoor. This place was a sortof genteel house of detention for offenders of the upper and intellectual
        <pb n="413" />classes, and Mike considered it an honor that the government had recognized his noble status to the extent of confininf [sic] him there in the company of so great a scholar. The linguist, who had murdered his wife, went on with his editing from his safe retreat, and took Mike on as pupil and bright disciple. Most of Mike's education, which got him by in fairly cultured society from time to time, had been acquired in this famous asylum for wealthy and learned offenders.</p>
        <p>So, pacing the floor and smoking his pipe, Mike, at my prompting, told his story. Not precisely the same story he had been telling, but a good one, so holeproof that I've never seen any convincing effort to tear it to pieces factually.</p>
        <p>We published it next day, Saturday, September 6, 1923, with three-column head, three-column portrait of Mike, under the title "The Story of My Life," under the by-line, "By Michael Obolensky." It was preceded by this box editorial introduction:The Eagle presents the accompanying statement of Mr. Dimitri in pursuance of its traditional policy of printing both sides of every controversy. Aside from this, The Eagle considers it a most remarkable story. It furnishes an hypothesis whereby all the evidence thus far presented against the man may be explained. Whether he be, as he says, the son of an emperor, or merely the son of an unknown commoner, he is a stranger in a strange land, and he is penniless. He has done no wrong, broken no law, while among us here in Wichita, and he has comported himself in a gentlemanly manner at all times. Under those circumstances, The Eagle cannot join in any persecution of him. As to the truth or falsity of any statements made by this most interesting man in the accompanying article, The Eagle has no opinion.</p>
        <p>Thus the tale began:My name is Michael Dmitri Obolensky Romanoff. My father was Alexander the Third, czar of all the Russias. My mother was Princess Olga Obolensky, not of royal blood, but a princess in her own right. There are not more than twenty-five people in the whole world who know these facts, but they are facts that are duly recorded in the archives of the Russian Empire.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="414" />I was beginnign [sic] to fancy myself as a ghost writer when I had got thus far, and the story was unreeling rapidly. I took no notes, but typed rapidly, interrupting myself only to ask a specific question, and silencing my story-teller when he had supplied the desired information.</p>
        <p>There were several sentences giving the Prince's reasons for thus relating the true story, mostly concerned with his desire to relieve the humiliation of his few friends in Wichita. Then came the phase of the story which varied from the story he had thus far told.</p>
        <p>The Emperor was morganatically married to my mother in the private chapel in St. Petersburg in 1891 or 1892; I am not sure of the date. The marriage was a court secret for a tme, and never became known to the people outside the court, as it was told about the empire that this was one czar who would not have more than one wife. In Russia, as in many countries, the royalty may marry morganatically without restrictions, and the children of such marriages are legitimate.</p>
        <p>He tells of his mother's unpopularity at court, and of the death of the Czar, who was assassinated in 1894. Then of his mother's dilemma, with the one-year-old son, and:She took me away from Russia. We lived at Baden-Baden, at Deuville, in London; I know not where else. When I was about eight years old my mother, for reasons best known to herself, brought me to America. A servant and a tutor accompanies [sic] us. We lived in New York.</p>
        <p>Soon after coining to New York the old servant who had taken care of me since my birth died. My mother employed an American woman named Ferguson to take the vacant place. When we had been in New York less than a year, as I remember the time, my mother died. The income that my mother received from somewhere ceased with her death......I was left on the hands of the governess, Mrs. Ferguson, who was a poor woman. Because my name was difficult for Americans to pronounce, she called me Harry, and I was generally known by her family name.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="415" />The story proceeds to tell how Mrs. Ferguson eventually placed the boy in the care of a children's society, which kept him, in a big building in New York for a time, and then sent him West. He was placed in the care of a man named Cronk, a farmer who was known as Judge. Harry ran away from the farm after a month and walked to Hillsboro. There he earned a precarious living, doing chores and odd jobs.</p>
        <p>Mike, according to the story as now developed, became psychotic, worrying about his mother, whom he cane to believe was still living. So he set out to hunt for her. He rode freight trains eastward, met a kind conductor who took him into the caboose, end arrived in New York. Let Mike take it:I immediately hunted up the home of the society that had taken charge of me, and there I was told that friends from Russia had been hunting for me.....I was taken in charge by emissaries of the royal family of Russia. They reclothed me and took me back to Russia.</p>
        <p>I may have been two years in St. Petersburg. Then I was sent to London and entered as a student at Eton, under my real name, at the age of thirteen years. I remained at Eton until I was sent up to Oxford...I received my B.A. degree in 1914 from Magdalene college. I was in England for more than a year, in the British army for fifteen months, wounded at Mons, returned to Russia, served as Colonel of the Cossacks.</p>
        <p>Then, says Mike, service for the Czar during the first revolution, against the Bolsheviks in the second revolution, imprisoned eight months, escaped to Constantinople, back to England in 1919. Like then explains his troubles with the London police, the shirt incident, repeated embarrassments about true identity, since he did not want to tell of the morganatic marriage of his parents. The closing:I have not cheated anybody. I have not hurt anybody. I have not done any mean or ignoble thing. I have nothing to be ashamed of, but I had my own intimate secret, which, for the sake of others, I had hoped to keep. Even that I now give up to you. Will you not,
        <pb n="416" />then, let me live in peace and earn a scant living as Michael Dmitri, laborer?</p>
        <p>I handed Mike his ticket to Chicago, and he carried his trunk, containing all his possessions, from his apartment to the Eagle building, a distance of nearly three long blocks. Then Mike asked me how he would eat. I said, "You told me of a magazine article you have written, saying farewell to America and giving some of your impressions of the country. If it's readable, I'll give you fifteen dollars for it."After much hesitation and soul-wrestling, Mike produced the article [sic]. It was neatly typed, evidently by someone other than Mike, perhaps one of the girl friends lately made. Reading a few lines, I was amazed at the excellent English and choice of expressions.</p>
        <p>I must have made a mistake in assuring that this man couldn't write! Here was a gem of self-expression. I had a bargain!</p>
        <p>We copyrighted the article and featured it on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Several months later we found the article, "My Farewell to America," by the famous English author, Henry W. Nevinson, in one of the Atlantic readers used at Friends university in an English course. It had been published originally in the Baltimore Sun, then in the Nation &amp; Atheneum of London. It chanced that I was the only person in Wichita who subscribed for both there publications. What a chance the Prince took on my being too busy to read Nevinson!</p>
        <p>But we had not closed the Prince story; merely opened it. In a few days I had a telegram from C.D. Johnston, city editor of The St. Paul Daily News, asking about the character of Prince Dimitry, who had turned up there, seeking a job and giving me as reference. I sent a non-commital [sic] reply, saying I didn't know anything about his nobility, but that he had not violated the law, to my knowledge, while in Wichita.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="417" />Correspondence followed. Mike had got to Chicago all right, spent most of his small pocket money, and, remembering that I had many friends in St. Paul, had boarded a Pullman for that place. When the conductor came around for his transportation, the Prince shouted that he had been robbed, threatened reprisals, suits, international complications. The poor conductor was so badly frightened that he took Mike on to his destination free of charge and tried in every way to mollify him.</p>
        <p>The newspaper got him a job as translator of some Russian manuscripts in the St. Paul library, but the Prince said the stuff was worthless, and so badly written that he would not attempt to translate it. He held the job five days. By that time he had made friends with two important wealthy families, the railroad Hills and the lumber Weyerhausers. A big-hearted lady thrust an immense roll of currency upon him when he said he wanted to go to Harvard for a special course in oil engineering. He knew where the big oil deposits were, he explained, but couldn't trust the geological engineers, so must learn enough to handle the prospecting job himself. Of course he would not forget his St. Paul benefactors when the gushers carte in.</p>
        <p>Off to Harvard he went, enrolled in the graduate course in oil geology, and began giving interviews about international affairs. He told an interviewer for the "Crimson" that study was much more intelligently handled at Oxford than at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Now it chanced that A.W. Hinkel, the generous Wichita merchant who paid Mike twenty-five dollars a week, was a subscriber to the "Crimson." He at once wrote the editor, exposing Mike and asking return of his small loan. That ended the royal career at Harvard, and we shall leave the Prince, as he leaves the Yard, for present.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="VIII">
        <p>One of my quieter, but more persistent, battles during my Wichita editorship was a continuing effort to interest the citizens in flying, and to provide for this city, plop in the center of Continental United States, facilities to attract the air traffic that I foresaw as inevitable.</p>
        <p>This was about the loneliest of all my struggles. While it raised up no armed thugs or hooded gangsters as enemies, it was greeted with amused indifference by the whole town. Not least among the amused was my immediate boss, Marcellus Murdock, publisher.</p>
        <p>Hardly a day passed without an editorial advocating that the municipality interest itself in flying, and prepare to think about buying land for a landing field. I at this time coined the word air minded, with its sister, airmindedness. These words caught on around the world long before my ideas of coming air traffic caught on in Wichita.</p>
        <p>One Sunday afternoon Marcellus entered my disorderly little sanctum, smoking an aromatic Havana, and, after greetings, said, "Charlie, do you know that the whole town is laughing at you?""Well," I answered, "I can't say that I was aware of it, but I am neither surprised nor interested. I know the natives find it extremely amusing that I don't wear a hat on the street; also that I wear nose-glasses with a cord on them. Although I'm the only one in town addicted to such fantasies, still, there must be others in other cities. I have no defense, and don't give a damn.""But that's not the big laugh, Charlie. It's this continual dream-talk of yours about fleets of passenger-carrying airplanes going through the sky and alighting in Wichita. That would be all right for
        <pb n="419" />a Jules Verne wonder book, or something like that, but you can't expect sensible people to take you seriously.""Let them take it any way they want to," I said. "Let them go to hell, in fact. They laughed harder than that at your dad when he started talk about getting a railroad into Wichita. And, as a consequence, all the main lines parsed us by, making something more than backward villages out of Kansas City and Omaha. This is Wichita's last chance to become a city....but I'm boring you. Go on out and laugh with the Board of Commerce crew. I've got a lot of work to do.""Well, Charlie, I don't mind if it entertains you and keeps you off the backs of the street car company, the electric light company, and the other friends of the paper. I just thought I'd tell you that they all think you're crazy."I went on with my writing, and turned out another airminded editorial.</p>
        <p>In part, it went thus:It now seems almost inevitable that the first main transcontinental air mail line will pass through Omaha, and not through Wichita. The chief reason for this state of affairs may not be the activity of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the inactivity of the Wichita Board of Commerce and the Wichita park commission. But without shedding any tears over milk that is badly spilled, may be not hope that Wichita still will get on the air map? It is not too late. When the Union Pacific missed us, our pioneers did not despair. They went out after other roads, and got them, and Wichita surpassed all her near rivals. In the present rivalry for places on the air map, there are still many prizes to be won. There is a possibility of a transcontinental southern route, branching off at Chicago and passing through Kansas City and Alburquerque [sic]. If this route is established, either as a mail route or a commercial proposition, it will go through Wichita or Hutchinson.</p>
        <p>Wichita will not sit idly and let the air traffic of this country fly by without noticing its horn. A body of citizens will be found that will act before it is too late.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="420" />So, Marcellus and his friends of the hustling business world of Wichita had another good laugh. That was January eleventh, 1920.</p>
        <p>Returned flying veterans were barnstorming with the old training Jennies, which had been called flying coffins during the war and were now for sale as surplus property. These were two-place open-cockpit planes, with dual controls. The student sat directly behind the teacher, kept a hand on the job-stick, and took over conditionally upon instructions from the front seat. The craft was unimaginably primitive and unsafe, but the United States had to depend upon it in training fighters for combat. The ship itself never saw combat, nor, we have been told, did any other American-made plane in the First War to End Wars.</p>
        <p>A brave and modest young man named Leslie Peddicord, who had been an instructor at one of our airfields, came to Wichita with an old Jenny and offered to take up passengers, one at a time, for a nominal fee. He had found an alfalfa patch of nearly eighty acres on East Douglas avenue, known as the McKnight farm, and there kept his little ship staked out.</p>
        <p>Peddicord came to my office and invited me to take a ride with him, having been told of my persistent and allegedly insane campaign to promote flying in Kansas.</p>
        <p>I had my first flight over the East Side, over Fairmount, along the drainage canal, and over farms. At five hundred feet it was a thrilling view. I came down a confirmed and initiated flying enthusiast, and so have remained. About this time a tool-dresser In the Eldorado oilfield, east of Wichita was a canny Dutchman named Jake Moellendick, frugal and observant. Wages were high, and Jake saved his money, always looking for a chance to invest a few dollars here and there in acreage, sixteenths,
        <pb n="421" />or whatever offered a regard in new oil money. He made so much that he quit dressing tools and went prospecting on his own.</p>
        <p>Jake was in a snail town in the eastern part of Kansas when he had a telephone call from a friend, telling of a strike in Western Kansas. A promising well had been brought in. It was in wildcat territory, and acreage would be grabbed by speculators as fart as the trains would bring them there from Wichita, which was having something of a boon on its hands.</p>
        <p>Jake found a barnstormer named Matty Laird (or, formally, E.M. Laird) flying his Jenny out of a pasture near the town. He hired the young man to fly him to the new gusher, beat all the train-traveling speculators, and bought acreage for miles around the new well.</p>
        <p>Jake was rich over night. Rightly, he attributed much of his luck to that plane and pilot. He bought both of them out of hand, and, like a traditional fairy godfather, asked the pilot to express his dearest wish.</p>
        <p>"I want to design and build airplanes," said Laird.</p>
        <p>"That you shall do."So began, in a field east of Wichita, the town's first airplane factory, with a capacity of one plane.</p>
        <p>The result, the first Laird Swallow, and, in the years that have followed, more than forty thousand airplanes for war and peace. That a day-dreaming editor may sometimes see the future more clearly than his publisher is a thesis to which I have long held. As a footnote to this thesis, I submit this excerpt from an editorial entitled "Made in Wichita," published April 10, 1920:
        <pb n="422" />The first made-in-Wichita airplane has made its trial flights and has been found satisfactory....Some day some writer for a special airplane number of the Eagle will be digging through the files, trying to find the account of the completion of the first Wichita-made airplane, and he will be surprised to find that the initiation of such an important era in the history of the city was mentioned briefly in a small news item on page six, April 9, 1920. There he will find, briefly told, the story of the test flights of the first flying machine ever made in Wichita. In that day, possibly not so distant as it may seem just now, the highways of the sky will be open to the most conservative and careful citizen. The making of carriages for aerial transportation will be an intense industry, comparable to the automobile industry of today.</p>
        <p>And in that day Wichita almost surely will possess a publicly owned, close-in, well equipped aviation field. Old timers will amuse credulous youngsters by relating how a certain city administration in Wichita held out for years against appeals for establishment of the first public aviation field in Wichita. The names of the mayor and city commissioners and the city manager who thus raised their barrier of conservatism against the inevitable march of progress will be printed in historical reviews of the development of flying, and perhaps some of the numerous Eagle editorials on the subject will be clipped and reproduced for the delectation of the curious-minded. For the benefit of the historians of that future day it is here and now recorded that the city manager in question is named L.W. Clapp, the mayor is John L. Powell, and the commissioners are W.S. Hadley, C.M. Jackman, Lon Powell and Charles Hoover.</p>
        <p>Well, the aviation editions, celebrating Wichita's greatest industry, have come and gone, but I haven't heard that this editorial has been quoted in any of then. It's not likely to be, either, since it was written for the specific purpose of putting the publisher of the paper to shame.</p>
        <p>Just to remind ourselves that this and all other stories of the slow and painful development of an idea are merely one very old story,
        <pb n="423" />let be noted here that Jake Moellendick, who made possible the building of that first Wichita airplane died, a sick, discouraged old man, in dire poverty, and not at all sure that he was in his perfect mindl [sic]Laird became an important designing engineer, as did several of the men who worked in that first Wichita airplane factory.</p>
        <p>__________The United States Amy had started a recruiting campaign to get young men into the flying service. Lieutenant Earl Schaefer was detailed to fly an Army Curtiss-Hisso up to Wichita from Post Field, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and scatter good will, sunshine and encouragement to the infant aviation enterprises of the day, but more particularly to attempt to impress upon the people of Wichita that the Army would be much happier if there were some place to land in or near Wichita.</p>
        <p>Schaefer, who had been reared in the town and thence had gone to West Point, graduated, and gone into the flying branch, found his way by following the Santa Fe railroad all the way from Oklahoma, while a companion, Lieutenant Bryan Evans, held a railroad map in his lap and checked off the miles. This was May 30, 1919.</p>
        <p>The army men tethered their plane on a race track, west of town.</p>
        <p>As a farm boy I had sold produce to a Wichita restaurant owned and operated by Julius Schaefer, father of the Lieutenant. So the young man and I were friends at once. We managed to shame the Board of Commerce (which had changed its name from Chamber of Commerce in one of its periodical reorganizations) into sending a man out with us to look over possible sites for a publicly owned landing field. Somebody sent a photographer, and one of the newspapers published a picture of the little group, looking over a small pasture, just outside
        <pb n="424" />the city limits, eastward. Although Schaefer was only a lieutenant, he permitted me to quote him discreetly about the need of a growing city for a landing field, and I made the most of it in the paper.</p>
        <p>It was several years before Wichita heard of Schaefer again. He became vice-president of the Boeing company, did a magnificent job of building warplanes, including the B-29's, during the Second War to End Wars, and at this writing remains the Number One man in the great Wichita aviation and airplane manufacturing activities, and rather close to the top in the world of flying machines. The impressive factories over which he presides occupy far more ground than we visualized that day as a possible public landing field for the city.</p>
        <p>The city manager, L.W. Clapp, was a pioneer Wichitan, a successful money-lender, and a cold-blooded Tory aristocrat in a cow-and-hog town that was trying, despite him, to become a city. He wanted the town to stay right where it was, because he owned business property that would be in a blighted zone if the town expanded eastward, the only direction in which it could expand. He had been mayor when an awful scandal broke out of a sewer contract engineered by the then city manager. This manager was booted out before the public got hold of the facts in the scandal, and Clapp "volunteered at great personal sacrifice" to step in as Manager, so that he might cover up the scandal before it engulfed him and all the rest of the respectable crew.</p>
        <p>Clapp's great weakness in public office was that he considered the public a herd of slaves and himself the owner of the herd. Never did he bow to public opinion, no matter how loudly expressed. The very fact that the cost powerful newspaper editorially expressed a desire for a municipal aviation field caused him to shut his mind and his ears against such vulgar clamor. I gave him some bad days and
        <pb n="425" />sleepless nights, and his wife quit speaking to Murdock's wife, as Marcellus ruefully reported to me.</p>
        <p>"I'm not complaining, Charlie," said Marcellus with benignity beaming from his moon-like face, "but I thought you ought to know that I suffer a lot of humiliation and social stings because of your writing."I looked sympathetic and replied, "I'm sorry about that, if it's important to you. But of course we're not editing a newspaper for the social prestige of the Murdocks, are we? I understood from you and Victor that the purpose of the paper is much more public-spirited than that."The legislature created a park board, which had power to purchase land outside the city limits. Here was the instrument for getting the land for a flying field. So Clapp had the City Commission elect itself to the jobs of park board members and him as park commissioner. That would halt my insane plans for a landing field for flying machiner [sic]---for a while.</p>
        <p>__________On Prohibition, The Eagle had a record for keeping still most of the time and, whenever it spoke at all on the subject, of saying merely, that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor was prohibited by law, that this law was in the constitution of Kansas, and latterly in that of the United States; therefore the law should be obeyed.</p>
        <p>Before I took the editorship I talked over this matter with Victor Murdock. He explained that The Family (the capcials [sic] indicate the reverent pride in the tones of all Murdocks when on the subject of The Family) was really opposed to Prohibition, but that the subscribers apparently were for it, so the subject was soft pedaled.</p>
        <p>My training had been mostly anti-liquor. The Omaha Daily News was militantly against liquor because of the evil done by the brewers
        <pb n="426" />and distillers in Nebraska politics, and I had absorbed much of this spirit.</p>
        <p>The St. Paul Daily News was not editorially opposed to the saloons, but would not accept liquor advertising because of the necessity for fighting the booze ring in elections, from time to time. I had somehow escaped liberalization on the subject in New York. So The Eagle was now violently anti-liquor, and we got the Prohibitionist circulation for the first time in the paper's history.</p>
        <p>In fact, circulation was going fine. We were on the way to twice the circulation of our evening competitor. Publisher Henry Justin Allen became Governor of Kansas in spite of us. Once in office, he put through the Industrial Court Law, which caused strikes, violence, militia rule in time of profound peace, and a turmoil that was wine to my troubled spirit. We fought the Governor on every point, and he made so many blunders that he supplied us with plenty of ammunition. He prohibited a strike of railway switchmen and patrolled all railroads and most highways with militia for months, because the switchmen struck anyway. He jailed a little restaurant keeper for displaying a sign: "We are 100 percent In Favor of the Strikers."Here his old friend, William Allen White, parted company with the foolish Governor, and posted outside the Emporia Gazette office a sign saying: "We Are 60 Percent in Favor of the Strikers." Each day he increased the percentage, and dared the Governor to arrest him. The Governor stood it until about 80 percent sympathy was expressed, then arrested his old friend.</p>
        <p>This is the kind of folly upon which all dictators are wrecked. In The Eagle I thundered for civil rights, for White, and for Kansas.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, White was a great one for issuing challenges, but he was not one to stick to his guns. In this instance, instead of going
        <pb n="427" />to jail and forcing the iron fist of his opponent, he posted bail, quit defying the Governor, quit posting the bulletins about sympathy, and, eventually, was denied a trial by the Governor, who now feared the effects of his rash action upon public opinion. White could have killed the Industrial Court and military rule by standing his ground. He fiddled, and the iron rule went on until Allen's terror of office expired and the offensive law was repealed.</p>
        <p>I had much respect for Allen as a writer of invective, at which I fancied myself as being pretty good. But I had the advantage in the circumstance that Allen was too busy with outside scatters to pay much attention to his paper. He kept in editorial charge, during his absences, a rather ineffective and none-too-bright young man named Elmer Peterson, who couldn't write effectively. But when the Governor came back to sit in the editorial chair, even for a few days at a time, he launched a few good thunderbolts.</p>
        <p>I was especially fond of a bolt he hurled at me in the height of the battle. A certain judge in a mid-Kansas district court held the Industrial Court law unconstitutional. Editorially, I hailed the jurist with the words of Shylock in "Merchant of Venice": "O wise and upright judge! A Daniel come to Judgment!"Allen, in a two-column editorial, picked that one up and finished it off. It was at the time that the police and the Klan were scheming to kill me or get me out of town. Allen knew about this. His editorial spoke of the supposed learning of the opposition editor, and of his ability to quote Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>"However," he continued, "the learned editor should read on. He will find, from the mouth of the same character, a line that may presently fit his own case: 'I pray thee give me leave to go from hence; I fear I am not well.'"
        <pb n="428" />I could respect a foeman who could toss my grenades back at me so accurately and with such excellent wit.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="IX">
        <p>President Wilson left Washington September 3, 1919, to plead for his League of Nations on a speaking tour of the country. The Senate was giving him trouble, and Wilson counted upon his magnetic personality and noble phraseology to win the battle by a direct appeal to the people. The speaking schedule was heavy. The weather over most of the country was hot, and air conditioning was still in the future, Wilson was sixty-three, and had been under tremendous emotional and physical strain. This tour, scheduled to last almost a month, with speeches once to three times a day, was admittedly a great strain on an overburdened and overworked man. But the League of Nations seemed to Wilson to offer the world its only hope for continued peace, and he was determined not to give it up without a struggle. He said that American refusal to join the League "would break the heart of the world."The schedule called for a stop and an importent speech at Wichita toward the end of September, and we began at once to plan a great celebration.</p>
        <p>The Eagle was strongly behind the League idea. Like many other American editors and writers, I was completely won over to the President's way of thinking and thoroughly believed that, though the European diplomats undoubtedly had swindled him out of most of his Fourteen Points, the League, with American participation, might yet establish peace as the normal way of international life. I was a bit fanatical about it, as were many of the President's supporters.</p>
        <p>Form [sic] day to day, as press reports of the great tour came in, we in Wichita became more and more keyed up for the grand climax, the Wichita speech. It would be the first time a President ever had
        <pb n="430" />visited our town while in office. Almost as soon as the tour started from Washington suave strangers began to drop in for a few days, looking over the town, planning the route of the procession from Union Station to the Forum, our new and spacious public auditorium, which would seat five thousand people if well packed with extra chairs. Experts on seating, parades, crowd control end program building conferred with the Board of Commerce, the police department, and the dignitaries who would be seated on stage. The Secret Service agents inspected commanding positions along the route of the parade, required, lists of all who were to join it, and requested that some miles of rope be prepared to stretch along the curbs. The parade route must be kept free of other traffic. We weren't sure that we liked all the petty orders our officials were getting, but we were thrilled that we finally had achieved a position of such importance among the inhabited places of the world. All Secret Service movements were kept cut of the paper.</p>
        <p>About a week before the date, we were notified that the President's special train would arrive in Wichita in time for the address to be delivered about 11 a.m. on Wednesday, September 26. The old town began to wake up to its great coming glory.</p>
        <p>"Society" was on the move. And when small-town midwestern Society starts chiseling for respective places on committees and on the stage, bad blood boils all over the place. Mrs. Burt Doze (whose maiden name was Genevra Jocelyn) had been Society editor of the Eagle for a short time before her marriage. She and the 1919 Society editor had collaborated in editing and publishing the silliest little Blue Book ever devised. It was the usual instrument of polite blackmail and backbiting, not differing greatly in such respects from the regular Blue Books of New York.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="431" />While the Dozes never had rated Society, Burt being an employe [sic] of the Murdocks and consequently poor, Mrs. Doze now made herself a member of the staff again, and assigned herself to interview Mrs. Woodrow Wilson. She made her husband buy a new car, which he could not by any means afford, so that they might make a splash in the parade. She gave herself a position close to the Presence on the stage. She fastened to herself the then Society editor, and the two were to clean up the social angle of the Great Day. Gowns of all the wives of Board of Trade, Rotary, Kiwanis and Lions were described in long advance stories that made it appear that the political speech, aimed at uniting the nations of the world for peace, was really only a style show for the little Wichita Blue Book.</p>
        <p>"Colonel" Bob Timmons, a big, handsome pressagent [sic] for the Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Company, whose military rank and resplendent uniform were authorized by the Governor for staff parade purposes, was made chairman of the reception committee. Bob had done well for himself in taking advantage of inside advance information about gas and electric shares, and had a Cadillac that outshone any of the other cars that were to be in the grand shindig on The Day.</p>
        <p>Press headquarters were set up under the stage at the Forum, with wire accommodations for the press associations and telephones for the local papers. Fire and police arrangements were made, as nearly as possible, in conformity with the advice of the Secret Service.</p>
        <p>I was somewhat irritated by the Society angle that the town sillies were cooking up, and wrote: Do not think that you can change the course of international affairs by a private chat with President Wilson when he arrives in Wichita.</p>
        <p>It is necessary to issue this bit of advice because of the large number of persons who think everything would be all right if they
        <pb n="432" />could just talk to Mr. Wilson. ... Not everybody in Wichita can be put on the various reception committees. It is wholly immaterial whether any particular individual gets on the committees or not. The President would not become your bosom friend and get your third cousin a job in the Treasury department because you happened to be on a big reception committee in Wichita. Asking to be put on a reception committee is a good deal like asking to be invited to dinner, and yet the management reports that it has been deluged with importunate requests for places on the reception committee.</p>
        <p>Use good sense, maintain your customary self-respect, and avoid being classed as a bore, a crank, or a climber.</p>
        <p>The Presidential special pulled in during the night of the twenty-fifth, and was shunted ot [sic] a sidetrack about a half mile north of the Union Station, where police and Secret Service cordons were at once established.</p>
        <p>That morning's Eagle, delivered to the train almost as soon as it came to a halt, contained this lead editorial:The President of the United States is Wichita's guest today. He is here, not on a social visit, but on serious business. He has come to place before the people of the Southwest the most momentous situation that has come before him since he took charge of the nation's troubled destinies nearly seven troubled years ago. The other vital problems that have pressed for solution the President, with the assistance of the cabinet and the congress, has felt able to handle in the regular manner. But at last there has arisen a situation with which the ordinary machinery of government cannot cope successfully alone. The President appeals to the people.</p>
        <p>..... You are welcome here, Mr. President. The people of Wichita and of the Southwest are with you in your fight for the League of Nations. ... . We hope that from our welcome and our reception of your message you may receive some encouragement and inspiration to keep up the good fight, even unto victory.</p>
        <p>What a day dawned! Hotels, boarding and rooming houses, parks and parked automobiles furnished sleepage for the thousands of visitors from all over the Valley and the hills beyond, come to hear, see and cheer the great idealistic leader of humanity.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="433" />Secret Service orders were that NOBODY should be permitted to board the train, and that anything that might be given to the press would be handed out at the steps of the press car. Our reporters were unable to get nearer than a hundred feet to the train during the late hours of the night and early hours of the morning. It was taken for granted that these were usual precautions to insure restful sleep for the President and his party.</p>
        <p>The city was astir early, and traffic headed toward Murdock and Santa Fe avenues, where, the rumor spread, the train might at least be seen. But Secret Service had taken care of this. Traffic was shunted off the approaches, several blocks away.</p>
        <p>Everything was in place in the vast Forum (then one of the largest public auditoriums in the country), but the entrances were kept locked until two hours before the program was to begin. We regretted that we had not the great new invention which had made its first notable appearance a few days earlier, when the President had addressed a crowd of fifty thousand at a great public racetrack in San Diego, while standing in a glass enclosure. The new invention, called Magnavox, was touted as a possible means of saving the voices of public speakers under strain. Mo telling to what heights this instrument might go! The President would have to make the best of our facilities, and the Forum was notably bad as to acoustics.</p>
        <p>There was a band to lead the procession from Union Station, and an orchestra was in place in the Forum, poised to sound the fanfare as the Chief entered, and then to break in the National Anthem.</p>
        <p>Our reporters, messengers and pages were rehearsed and reedy. I had got my nephew, young Bernard Blood, a page's job, so that he might keep me informed concerning certain goings-on. I took up a wandering position, from pressroom to stage to audience, with the idea of contributing something to the "color story" of the great event.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="434" />The audience was seated, an hour before the tine for arrival of the President. There was some desultory singing of patriotic and popular songs, after the manner of a Kiwanis assembly, but mostly the crowd was restive in the heat, expectant, nervous. The stage "'as packed with a thousand committee members, all of the women wearing more expensive clothes than their husbands could afford, and the men looking glum and frustrated because their wives had told them that Mrs. X looked fine, of course, merely because her husband had encouraged her to spend some money on her hat. It was show-off day and getting-even day in Society, and you just see if I don't get a word with Mrs. Wilson!</p>
        <p>One long, hot hour the audience sat, the orchestra played, and the chairman, who was to introduce the chairman who was to introduce the Governor who was to introduce the President fumbled his manuscript, read it over to himself in a mumble, and adjusted his tie upon reception of Indian signs from his wife, in the fourth row center.</p>
        <p>During the next hour a messenger [sic] arrived from the reception committee saying that the audience should be patient. All would be well.</p>
        <p>At long last came a restle [sic] from the south stage door, through which the party was to enter. Men in uniform crowded forward in a group. Up went the flag, stage center.</p>
        <p>Colonel Bob Timmons stepped to the edge of the platform. He raised his right hand to quell the rising storm of huzzas. He said:"The President will be unable to speak today. That is all I can tell you."What dreams went toppling! And I do not mean the dream of the world of peace and a League of Nations that might stand against the storm.</p>
        <p>Before the train pulled out for Washington that afternoon I got to the press car, but got nothing important to print. Merely the opinion of a correspondent whom I knew. He said he tought [sic] the President
        <pb n="435" />had had a stroke during the night.</p>
        <p>Genevra Jocelyn Doze wrote a signed story about the dresses and a fake story about how close she got the almost seeing Mrs. Wilson.</p>
        <p>Tragedy was heavy over our town. The dresses had scarcely been seen by anybody that mattered, and the payments on those new cars would be due monthly, on the first.</p>
        <p>__________I went to Chicago in June, 1920, to cover the Republican national convention for the Eagle and gather some background for the coning presidential campaign. Henry J. Allen had become something of a national political figure, and had clinched a certain popularity among the anti-labor forces by slamming Samuel Gompers all over Carnegie Hall, New York, in a debate that was well covered by the press.</p>
        <p>The Eagle, traditionally Republican, but friendly to the League of Nations, could not see much light in the Republican sky this time. The Beacon was beating the drums for Leonard Wood, old friend of Henry Allen's, and we suspected that there was a deal to give Henry second piece on the ticket. The Kansas delegation, headed by Allen, went to Chicago pledged to vote for nomination of Wood.</p>
        <p>But Wood's popularity had been slipping badly in the days preceding the convention. There was a question as to his physical fitness. He was a casualty of the Spanish-American war, during which he had bumped his head against the frame of the door of his tent and sustained a brain injury. This had caused him to drag one foot slightly ever since. Much was made of this during pre-convention medicine-making because of Wilson's having been disabled by a stroke during the latter part of his incumbency. But worse than the Achilles heel was the scandal regarding campaign contributions. Wood, who had started as a favorite, was not a bright prospect as the convention got under way.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="436" />Because I knew personally most members of the Kansas delegation, and because many members were secretly anti-Allen, I was kept informed of an under-cover plot to ditch Wood at the psychological moment and carry first place for Allen by a big surprise hullaballoo.</p>
        <p>According to plan, during and after a speech for Wood by Allen, a demonstration for Allen was staged, and big pictures of him were broken out, greatly to the anger of the Wood forces. The demonstration petered out badly, but Wood's chances paled steadily as the voting went on.</p>
        <p>I attended a "secret" meeting of the Kansas delegation in which a deal was reported. Next day, on a given ballot, the Kansas delegation would switch to Harding of Ohio. Since Kansas was the head and front of the Wood delegations, other states would follow the Kansas lead, and on the next ballot Harding would be nominated, amid great excitement.</p>
        <p>The price for this switch was the nomination of Henry Allen for second place. Ohio promised, the party bosses promised, and the vice-presidency was in the bag for Our Henry. All this I reported, as fast as it took place, to my paper.</p>
        <p>The switch was made, as promised, and the demonstration for Harding was on. Next ballot, Harding nominated. Pandemonium.</p>
        <p>Speeches on vice-presidential aspirants were given no attention, and voting began amid terrific noise. Well, Kansas was not worrying.</p>
        <p>The Kansans were stunned when, during a fearful din, it was announced that a fellow named Calvin Coolidge, of Massachusetts, had been nominated as vice-president.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="437" />We've been robbed!" shouted the Kansans, and indignant peanut politicians assailed the bosses who had promised. I heard some of the conversations backstage. The only explanation offered was, "The boys never could see Allen. He has an anti-labor record that would hurt the ticket. Yes, we promised. But the bosses wouldn't back us up."And that's how come Coolidge became the thirtieth President of the United States, instead of Henry Allen of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Eagle was delighted that Allen had failed, and we did some fancy crowing.</p>
        <p>We waited, talked unhappily about the mediocre quality of the candidates picked at Chicago, and I sat in several conferences with the Murdocks. Reluctantly, we all agreed that we had to support Jim Cox and Frank Roosevelt, the sorry team picked by the Democrats at San Francisco. We made our announcement without enthusiasm, and our campaign editorials were restrained criticisms of Harding and Coolidge, without any fervor in our support of the Democratic candidates. We recognized all of them as mediocrities, and feared for the dignity of the high offices at stake, no matter who won. Harding's commitment [sic] to Jake Hamon, a dissolute Oklahoma oil man, was well known. Hamon was to be Secretary of the Interior, with those rich federal oil lands of Teapot Dome and in California under his thumbs, in return for a large contribution to Harding's pre-convention and post-convention campaigns.</p>
        <p>But Jake Hamon was murdered by his paramour shortly after the nomination. Harding sent a telegram, calling Jake a great and a good man," and we crucified him for that. So it was Albert Fall, another shady character, who got the handling of the oil loot and served time for his theft eventually. Se [sic] can an intoxicated lady sometimes change the course of history with a bullet.</p>
        <p>The idealism of Wilson had gone sourt [sic] on the country's stomach, and disillusionment was rampant. Cynicism gripped most of the newspapers. It was hard to keep up an idealistic front editorially, but I tried it. That was why I never said that Cox and Roosevelt would be a credit to the country, but only that they would be better than Harding and Coolidge.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="438" />I still think that they might have been. They couldn't have been worse.</p>
        <p>__________My lack of interest in the political campaign, continued annoyance by the Klan, which I fought day by day without encouragement from my owners, and a growing conviction that I was wasting good career tine in Wichita, where I had no intention of remaining permanently, added up to an understanding between my wife and me that we would take the first good chance for a job in the East. Correspondence with George Martin, my old Omaha-New York friend, continued, but it didn't seem to be leading to anything positive in regard to a New York place. George did wire me several times about jobs, on mid-continent magazines and publications, but none of them seemed worth moving for.</p>
        <p>But I sensed the circumstance that George's unhappiness had led him to drink much more than was good for him, though he continued to rise in the heirarchy [sic] of the Crowell Publishing company, where he was now making of the formerly hopeless Farm &amp; Fireside a veritable weekly mint. He was slowly accumulating stock in the company, and wage increases were handed him liberally. George introduced me to his friends and superiors, as well as to his fellow-workers on his farm publication. I was impressed by the good humor and apparent ability of one of them, Wheeler McMillen, who was full of ideas for better farming.</p>
        <p>I had bought and sold two pairs of building lots, and had abandoned the project of building a home in Wichita, after having plans drawn. I had made a modest profit on each of the realty deals.</p>
        <p>A lively correspondence had grown up with Hendrik Willem van Loon, who was engaged in writing "The Story of the Bible" while working as editorial page man on the Baltimore Sun, for which I was continuing to write about the Western scene, the woes of the farmers, and the political mess in Kansas. I was writing also an occasional piece for The
        <pb n="439" />Nation and for the Country Gentleman, besides rather steady streams of prose and verse for farm publications over the country.</p>
        <p>I tried to induce van Loon to modernize his Bible story by injecting a little humor here and there. He replied that he wanted to make money, not become a funny man. When I came to know him better I realized to what an amazing extent he lacked any sense of humor, and it was then easy to understand that my suggestion had been quite out of place.</p>
        <p>Meantime, I had taken on as a contributor of occasional pieces for the paper in Wichita our genial and intelligent Congregational minister, Rev. Hubert C. Herring, whom I first met during organization of the Hammer &amp; Tongs club. He had liberal ideas, favored the league of Nations, shied away from the Kansas Industrial court and its theory of armed force for settlement of labor disputes, and wanted to write.</p>
        <p>Herring was not in the last religious, but there was a long ministerial tradition in his family, and he had been more or less forced to follow the family line into the pulpit. He was a better preacher than writer. He did not use the pulpit oratory then in vogue in Kansas (and elsewhere), but stuck to a conversational style of speech, which I also used in my rather frequent and unprofitable public appearances. He was fighting the Klan, which had only a frail standing in his church, but was ravening for his blood in many of the other churches.</p>
        <p>This high-minded pastor of souls and I had much in common. The Methodists and Bapists [sic] had brought to town a woman who posed as an "escaped nun," who was one of the most virulent of the anti-Catholic missioners of souls in that era. This woman conducted such a successful campaign, with heavy money backing by some of our prominent merchants, that she often filled three churches a day, telling the "secrets of the convents," and assuring the good ladies in the afternoon audiences that every Catholic girl had to sleep with the priest on her wedding night
        <pb n="440" />or the night before if travel plans made the wedding night itself unavailable for this somnolent ceremony.</p>
        <p>One result of this surprisingly effective campaign was that many of the women in our neighborhood quit speaking to my wife, and the same thing happened all over town. The Eagle office was crawling with Klansmen, and I was not having a pleasant time.</p>
        <p>Herring projected a series of lectures in his church, under the general theme, "Neighbors." He got a minister or college president to speak on "My Neighbor, the Catholic," himself spoke on "My Neighbor, the Negro," and asked me to speak on "My Neighbor, the Jew."My night was the big night, because of my militant editorials against the Klan and the rapidly organizing effort to "run that damn Catholic editor out of town." The church was packed to the doors, mostly with klan [sic] people. I talked for an hour on the greatness of the Jews, and made a pretty good case.</p>
        <p>There was little applause, some booing. In the question period nasty hecklers got nasty answers. As the crowd was leaving, I walked into the audience to meet my family and friends, and, while walking out with the crowd was set upon by a fat woman who beat me about the shoulders and head with her fists. It wasn't at all bad, and there was comparatively little commotion.</p>
        <p>During this period we had some flaming revivals, including those operated by Aimee Semple McPherson and Gipsy Smith. They got good editorial notice and good news breaks, and both evangelists became my personal friends. Both kept clear of Mannishness.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McPherson had some characteristics in common with Mary Garden, who visited us as a member of the Chicago Opera company. Both women were robust, and both had the sane technique in making unpaid pressagents [sic] out of newspapermen. Both would get behind the newsman's chair while talking up their shows and looking over his shoulder to see the copy,
        <pb n="441" />could carelessly brush tho shoulders and back of the neck of the victim with their plentiful bosoms. If a man didn't write a brilliant story after this treatment, he was a lost soul. One of our men was so thoroughly converted by Mrs. McPherson in this manner that he wrote a factual news account of how the evangelist had successfully commanded the winds and the rain at Arkansas City, a short distance from Wichita. She just raised her hands to heaven and shouted her orders, and the wind died; the rain dried.</p>
        <p>__________Warren Harding started out in the heat of the summer of 1923 to make his preliminary campaign for the 1924 election. His presidency had been a scandal, or a series of scandals, as all the world now knows. Official Washington reeked of crime, including suicide, murder, theft, larceny and malfeasance in office. Some of the stuff was leaking to the public. Harding was frightened, but afraid to quit, for feat [sic] that his successor night discover some of the real dirt and put practically the whole government of the Harding regime behind bars, or worse.</p>
        <p>So the President would visit Alaska, at public expense, taking Mrs. Harding, the silly old Doctor Sawyer and a host of sycophants and buddies along in the "official" party. On the way he would make policy speeches which would sound the keynotes for the next campaign.</p>
        <p>One speaking stop was Kansas City. I went there to hear the speech, size up the political situation, and meet some old friends. I spent the day before the speech in a Kansas City hotel, and made an attempt to get to the presidential party, which had a whole floor of the Muehlbach hotel.</p>
        <p>I met Senator Arthur Capper of Kansas, old friend of mine, publisher of the Topeka Capital, and jolly buddy of Harding. Capper said, "You
        <pb n="442" />want to see the President? Get right into the elevator with me. I'm going up to see him now."I got in and was put off one floor below the President's floor. I was followed by Secret Service men who told me I could not go to the presidential floor at all. Though I made my identity know [sic], these tough boys followed me until they put me to bed in my own hote [sic].</p>
        <p>That night I sent a news story to the Eagle, signed. It was printed on page one, all editions, under a banner line. It started out thus:"When Francis the First of France went to visit King Henry the Eighth of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, near Calais, in the year Fifteen-Twenty A.D., the royal route was posted with this notice:"IF ANY COMMONER COME WITHIN TW0 LEAGUES OF TIIE KING'S TRAIN? LET HIM BE BEHEADED.</p>
        <p>"Warren Harding came to Kansas City today. Commoners were forbidden to tee off for two hours before Harding appeared at the Country Club for a game.</p>
        <p>I was forbidden to visit the floor on which is the presidential suite at the Muehlbach."The story went on to tell how I had been forbidden to board the press car of the royal train on the morrow, but must be satisfied to follow meekly in another train, reserved for commoners, to Hutchinson, the first stop in Kansas.</p>
        <p>The Eagle was a Republican paper, even though it had not supported Harding, and, according to political gossip, it might be influenced, to support the ticket in 1924. It was the most powerful paper in Kansas and Oklahoma. It was the only paper delivered on the presidential train at Hutchinson, and that story made a little bit of history that day.</p>
        <p>The entourage was torn by a conflict centering around:1) The President's health, which was bad.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="443" />His drinking, which was very bad.</p>
        <p>3) Whether, in view of these considerations, he should keep aloof, save his energy, and be dignified, or plunge into baby-kissing and vote-getting as of yore.</p>
        <p>That story of mine on page one settled the strife. The down-to-earth and kiss-the-babies party won. But Mrs. Harding forbade the servants to nix or serve any liquor for Warren during the stop in Hutchinson, heart of the prohibition dry country.</p>
        <p>Crowds had gathered around the interesting old Hisonte hotel, where the royal party (now no longer royal) was staying, for the President was going to harvest wheat in a neighboring field. I was apprehended by my old friend, Senator Capper. "The President wants to see you," he said.</p>
        <p>"That's a good story. Something like the one you told me in Kansas City yesterday, just before they tossed me off the elevator.""No, but this is true. He's sorry about what happened yesterday. He has read the piece you wrote in this morning's Eagle, and he wants to talk." "Well, he can't give me any hell for what I write, you know.""He hasn't the slightest intention. In fact, he thinks the story is funny --- and it is."Capper led me through a back door and up the back stairs of the little hotel. "We'll let ourselves into the kitchen," he said.</p>
        <p>"There'll be too many people in the other rooms."We stepped in. There was only one person in the kitchen of the suite. It was President Harding. He was in shirt-sleeves, and was pouring rye whiskey out of a flat pint bottle into a bowl in which there was cracked ice. He was mixing for himself a king-sized drink.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="444" />When he saw us he looked foolishly confused and, sticking out his right hand in greeting, he stuck his left index finger into the mouth of the bottle and placed the bottle in his hip pocket. We talked for fifteen minutes.</p>
        <p>During all that time the President was backed up against the kitchen sink, his hand and the whiskey bottle in his left hip pocket.</p>
        <p>"That was a good article you wrote for this morning's Eagle," said Harding, as soon as we were introduced. Then he said, "Are you related to Victor Murdock?"I said I was not.</p>
        <p>"Strangely enough, you look not unlike him," he said. I said that that had been remarked by a few persons who knew us both.</p>
        <p>I inquired seriously about his health, as I had noticed that his hands trempled [sic] and his face had an ashen case. He assured me that he was feeling fine.</p>
        <p>We then talked lightly of the national scene, something about the trip that was to take so long, and about the Kansas crops.</p>
        <p>Because of the President's awkward position, I suggested that we leave before he became tired, and we exchanged friendly farewells. After we were out of the hotel Capper said, "You won't say anything about the whiskey, will you?" I assured him that I would not.</p>
        <p>In answer to my request, the President had given me specific permission to quote him directly in reporting the interview, though I had taken no notes. I did, and it was a good news story, the only direct quotes interview Harding gave out during his presidency. I said in the story that Mr. Harding was mixing a glass of lemonade during our visit.</p>
        <p>After riding on a harvester around a small wheatfield, Harding ended his Hutchinson stop, boarded a train for the West, and never returned. In San Francisco he died on August 2, 1923, in circumstances
        <pb n="445" />deemed mysterious by many.</p>
        <p>Our troubles with the Klan were not mending. I published denunciatory editorials after every atrocity committed by the hooded hoodlums, and one Sunday editorial cost us four hundred subscribers in one little Butler county, community. Nevertheless, our overall circulation figure was growing; that of our competitor shrinking.</p>
        <p>A squint-eyed little fellow called Cookie went among the advertisers who were members of the Klan, and, in a month or so, had signatures to two written promises. First, the signers would add so many dollars (a specified sum) to their advertising contract with the Eagle for the following year if the newspaper would get rid of its present editor. Secondly, the signers would subtract a definite sum from their next year's Eagle advertising contract, or, in many cases, cancel it altogether, if the editor remained editor.</p>
        <p>Cookie worked hard, and he knew his customers, as he met with them at the Klavern regularly.</p>
        <p>When the two documents were ready, they were presented to Marcellus Murdock. This is what the ultimatum said: "Fire the Catholic and we sign up for a total of seventy-five thousand dollars more in advertising next year than we are paying you this year. Keep him, and we will withdraw exactly that much from what we are now spending with you."This was a hard saying. Marcellus got in touch with Victor in Washington at once.</p>
        <p>Meantime, one of the big banks failed to open its doors. It had been robbed, ruined, wrecked from within. Even the safe deposit boxes of the customers had been forced and contents stolen. State band examiners had given the bank a great buildup as a model of strength and trustworthiness, even after it had been looted. Coming of the examiners
        <pb n="446" />was tipped off, and a party to the crime came galloping down Douglas avenue with a truckload of gilt-edged bonds. Tables groaning with securities greeted the pleased and complacent examiners. When they had departed the co-conspirator came and took his bonds away. The losses involved not only the usual victims in such cases, but the funds of the local Catholic diocese, the Board of Education's funds, and the holdings of several charitable organizations. There was little to be salvaged out of the wreck.</p>
        <p>Since I didn't have enough fights on my hands, I took on the bank situation, demanding, as I had a right and duty to demand, that the guilty bankers and conspirators be sent to prison.</p>
        <p>Marcellus came to my office and explained that one of the persons involved was the father-in-law of one of our largest advertisers. I said that I could not see how that could be of any interest to the editorial side.</p>
        <p>There was one department store that had been cutting down its advertising in the Eagle and increasing its Beacon lineage. The proprietor of that store was refusing to negotiate any new Eagle contract, and threatened to give all his business to the opposition.</p>
        <p>Marcellus told me a story about this gentleman's alleged past, and wanted me to go to a certain city, all expenses paid, to dig up the unsavory tale, with written evidence. With this story in hand, he thought he could get the contract for next year's advertising.</p>
        <p>I refused flatly to have anything to do with that kind of enterprise, and said I'd rather keep away from the business problems anyway. I knew that the man in question was one of my worst enemies in the town, but I couldn't see in the proposal put before me any prospect of clean hands for evermore. The project was dropped, so far as I know. But the advertising from that store was eventually signed up somehow.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="447" />I had a letter from Victor, enclosing a note from Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby, inviting Victor to be his official guest, along with a few other newspaper publishers, on a junket cruise in the Caribbean. Victor said he would turn the invitation over to me as his substitute, and I decided to go. Expenses to and from ports of departure and return would be paid by the newspaper; all else to be on the Navy.</p>
        <p>I accepted. My wife took the children to St. Paul to be with her parents during the six weeks or so of my absence. We locked up the little cottage on East Pine street, and I joined the main battle fleet at Charleston, S.C.</p>

        <p>The transport Henderson took aboard nearly one hundred Newspaper people, of whom only two or three were writers. I was the sole representative of what is properly termed the working press. That is to say, I was neither an owner nor a publisher, but a writing editor doing a job of writing on this trip. I wrote a regular series of stories about the trip for my paper and took extensive notes for future use.</p>
        <p>Seldom do working press people go on such junkets, because the men who hand out the tickets and privileges are themselves business men or politicians and therefore know nothing about the real problem of getting favorable publicity for their ventures. They are apt to have personal acquaintance with owners or publishers, and are almost certain to be impressed with the power of these moguls of the press. They do not realize that almost no good public relations will grow out of entertaining publishers, who, in many cases, cannot write anything except a signature on a check or contract.</p>
        <p>The cruise was profitable for me because it enabled me to meet many newspaper executives away from their desks, to study their "attitudes toward the world and their work, and to size up the sectional opinion groups through long conversational sessions on deck, especially after we got into the Gulf Stream and nights were balmy.</p>
        <p>Before leaving Wichita I had the Eagle bindery make for me a blank book for my notes and pictures. To this I gave the title "To Hell and Gone," and it provided an amusing occupation when activities were few. E. K. Gaylord, publisher of the Oklahoman and Times, of Oklahoma City, was the first shipmate with whom I became well acquainted. He was a prohibitionist and a teetotaler, as was I. Oklahoma and Kansas had much in common, so I found Gaylord interesting, though, I thought,
        <pb n="449" />mostly interested in business success. I induced him to write the "foreword" for my little book.</p>
        <p>W.F. Hardy, editor of the Decatur (Ill.) Herald, wrote "Another Foreword."On shipboard I met my old friend and St. Paul editor, H.B.R. Briggs, who, since my Minnesota days, had been booted out of the editorship of the St. Paul Daily News because he advocated formers' [sic] cooperative elevators, packing houses and stores. Advertisers convinced Larry Ashbaugh, majority owner of the paper, that the co-ops were threatening their businesses, and that the merchants could not much longer continue to advertise in the News.</p>
        <p>Briggs had gone into service with the Scripps-Howard organization, had served a term as editor of the Rocky Mountain News, and was now at the helm of the original Scripps newspaper, the Cleveland Press. The paper was more prosperous than it had ever been, and Briggs seemed more happy and optimistic than I had known him to be in St. Paul.</p>
        <p>Briggs wrote for my little book a "Preface," and then inquired as to my Wichita work. I told him that I was tired of the job, that my policies had only negative backing on the part of the owners, and that I was looking toward New York again.</p>
        <p>He suggested that I cable my resignation from the first land station and go back to Cleveland with him, as associate editor of the Press. I did not take the suggestion seriously, but Briggs renewed it from time to time during the trip.</p>
        <p>There was serious drinking throughout the voyage, and I enjoyed some of the alcoholic sessions almost as much as the participants.</p>
        <p>I was amazed by the fabulous drinking performance of Lieutenant Commander M. S. Brown, who could come off duty completely sober, start drinking in any convenient place, keep up brilliant conversation with
        <pb n="450" />half a dozen newspapermen, and finish, near dawn, sitting in a bath tub with dignity unimpaired and an empty bottle in his hand. Brown always turned up at ness [sic], sober, neat, clean, and dignified, and liquot [sic] never interferred [sic] with his duty. Briggs was one of the milder of his drinking companions, and I loved to hear the brilliant conversation.</p>
        <p>Brown wrote "Another Preface" for my book. By this time the guest writing had become a game. Everybody wanted to get into the act.</p>
        <p>Captain John H. Craige, Marine Corps, wrote a "Prelude," and Dwight B. Heard, wealthy politician and publisher of the Arizona Republican, of Phoenix, asked me to reserve a page for him. However, he was a tireless collector of souvenirs, curios and all manner of tourist trash, and kept me busy with his collecting that he never found an opportunity to fill out his page. Heard's loot amounted to a truckload when the trip ended. Some of it is preserved in an Arizona museum.</p>
        <p>Paul Patterson, publisher of the Baltimore Sunpapers, rather disappointed my expectations. Because I had been writing for his papers and was friendly with Mencken, Van Loon and most of the Sun staffs, I expected to have some good conversations with the big boss. But Patterson was interested chiefly in admirals, statesmen, other top brass, and millionaires. We lesser fellows had little opportunity to converse with him.</p>
        <p>Patterson was then forty-seven, seven years my senior. He was handsome, full of vigor, and perhaps overflowing just a little bit with self-confidence.</p>
        <p>In later years I met him several times. He seemed to have mellowed; perhaps because more patient toward the world. He was anxious to converse amiably. Years and living do sometimes tame the forward-straining of confident and ambitious men and modify self-esteem with a charity that makes way for esteem for others.</p>
        <p>Patterson took a page in my blank book for an "Introduction." It
        <pb n="451" />consisted of two words: "Hell's bells!"J.C. Collier, publisher of the Dubuque Times-Journal, wrote what he called an "Advertisement" for the book.</p>
        <p>Chaplain George B. Dranz, of the battleship New Mexico, to which I was transferred when we reached the Caribbean, wrote a poem covering two pages. It was entitled "A Hell of a Note," and was all about the habitual use of the word hell in almost every imaginable sense. It was humorous, but probably not original. Father Kranz hailed from Erie, Pa., and told me news of relatives there.</p>
        <p>Herbert J. Winn, publisher of the Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle, owner of a large company making scientific instruments, a typical American town-booster, wrote "A Few Remarks," and told me all about Rochester and its commercial-scientific glories. In later years I verified many of his statements on visits to Rochester. I decided then that Winn just couldn't help boosting such a boostable town.</p>
        <p>W.H. Powell, editor of the Ottumwa Courier, was a contributor and a partaker in many of the discussions about the Navy. These talks usually were inspired by some officer assigned to our groups. Obviously, the object of the cruise was indoctrination of the press with Big Navy ideas.</p>
        <p>Many of the inland editors and publishers, inducing Briggs and myself, were not enthusiastic about spending large sums on the Navy, and certain appropriations were now being considered in Congress.</p>
        <p>Henry E. Armstrong, editorial writer on the New York Times, was the leading Big Navy man in the party. He was well informed on the navies of the world. He shocked me by saying that the British navy was our chief protector, and that every gun added to its strength was just so much additional insurance for us. I did not hold with this
        <pb n="452" />view, and gained little in popularity among the Navy folk by offering the idea that Britian [sic] was at best a weak prop for a strong nation to reply upon.</p>
        <p>F.W. Eldridge, managing editor of the Los Angeles Examiner, and Elmer E. Clarke, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, were convivial companions and interesting talkers. Clarke was the journalistic life of the all-night parties aboard the Henderson.</p>
        <p>Colonel John S. Cohen, commonly called Jack, managing editor of the Atlanta Journal, personally entertained many of the more sociable of the newspapermen and such officers as cared to partake of his hospitality. Jack brought aboard his own private supply of Southern corn whiskey, and many were the Northerners who, tasting it for the first time, became firm devotees of the Southern tradition. General Robert E. Lee became a favorite toast. These toasts came up so often that Hardy, of Illinois, and I, both abstainers, got little sleep in the cabin assigned to us. A large head (which we called a bathroom) was across from us, and there the Cohen parties were held. I usually capitulated about two in the morning, and joined up as observer.</p>
        <p>Cohen and I became fast friends on this cruise. I learned to respect his sturdy patriotism and his earnest desire to bring about closer understanding between North and South. The friendship was often renewed, in New York and Atlanta, until Choen's death.</p>
        <p>The Navy Department had supplied several lecturers and educators, and these were organized so that no guest was ever far away from someone who could answer any questions. Lieutenant John B. Heffernan gave informal talks, well attended by such members of the press as were able to navigate. In the course of a talk on the West Indies and the customs of their people, as we neared Porto Rico, the lieutenant told us that in one of the island replublics [sic] the government actually laid a tax on
        <pb n="453" />improvements, so that anybody who built an addition to his home or factory thereby subjected himself to additional taxes.</p>
        <p>Briggs, the radical editor, remarked, in a moderate tone of voice, "We do that, too."The speaker merely hesitated a moment, and, without comment, proceeded with his lecture as it had been approved by Authority.</p>
        <p>One of my best thrills on this trip cane as we sighted the low-lying coast of the island called San Salvador. I took a picture of the beach where Columbus landed. The inevitable mental reconstruction of that 1492 scene occupied the minds of many of us, to the exclusion of all else.</p>
        <p>My first tropical night was spent on deck, as we steamed slowly around the island of Haiti. The charm of it gripped me then, and that same charm was to return as a new experience, whenever I visited the tropics.</p>
        <p>We landed at Port au Prince. The U.S. Marines, who were running the island as a sort of American banking outpost, furnished cars and drivers for the visitors. Some local Americans volunteered their services and cars, too. Hardy and I were driven about, one day, by an American manager of an ice plant, subsidiary of Standard Oil. Our host spoke contemptuously of the natives, as, indeed, did most of the Americans we met. Said this one: "I've killed only one of them myself. When I first got this car I ran over a kid on this very road. I didn't stop, of course. These people make an awful fuss when an American runs over one of their kids. But when I drove along the road next day I passed a funeral." He knocked on the wooden rim of his steering wheel.</p>
        <p>We were guests at the fine home of Genral [sic] John Henry Russell, American High Commissioner, a top-flight officer of the Marines, who
        <pb n="454" />was made boss of Haiti by President Harding in 1922. The General and our Paul Patterson were friends at once, but many of us spent most of the time appreciating the scenery, which was marvelous from this mountainside situation.</p>
        <p>General Russell was born at Mare Island and was graduated from Annapolis, so he rose rapidly to this high commissionership. He had served in the Spanish-American war and in many of the tropical encounters that made the Marines famous. He was managing Haiti with a strict hand and a lot of rifles, but not altogether without friction. In a small den of discontent I met the natives who were opposing United States occupation. These included two editors, some professional men of considerable intelligence, and a lot of native politicians. I was amazed to find here several U. S. marines. Some may have been spies, but a few talked openly of discontent and of American cruelty to the natives. One of the best talkers against the American Occupation was a Lieutenant Fitzgerald Brown, who had been questioned by a Congressional investigating committee only a few months previously, concerning cruelties in which he was involved. Yes, Brown told me, he had tortured natives as charged. He gave me full permission to quote him. He declared that the brass wasn't going to fire him, degrade him or punish him. He knew where the bodies were buried. Because the lieutenant obviously was slightly influenced by alcohol during his statements, I refrained from using the material in detail.</p>
        <p>Harry E. Elie and Dr. Joseph Geppard were among the revolutionaries who talked freely. They had been in prison more than once, and were not much afraid of the American occupying forces. They were looking forward to fun and revolution when the Americans should finally depart.</p>
        <p>The American press was given a ceremonial reception at the Presidential Palace. Down long aisles, forced by temporary tables loaded
        <pb n="455" />with all manner of cakes, remindful of the old Last Day of School feasts in Kansas, we walked slowly, while the drinking member of the party imbibed many kinds of wines and spirituous liquors, set forth in decanters at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>At the head of the line stood little President Louis Borno, a local Negro politician who was favored, for the moment, by the American interests in charge of the Republic. As Editor John S. Cohen was next in line ahead of me, I was abused by the circumstance that, despite Cohen's stout protestations of white supremacy and advocacy of the segregation of races as practiced in Georgia, he shook the extended hand of the black Borno. When I asked Cohen about it he had an answer that covered everything. "I wasn't shaking the hand of the Nigra," he raid, "but the hand of the head of a friendly state. Just the same as a soldier salutes an office, no matter what his color or character. It is a sign of respect for the office, not the individual."When the guests were transferred from the Henderson to warships of various types, I was assigned to the battleship New Mexico, 32,000 tons displacement, commissioned in 1918, and considered, at the time of our cruise, one of the most modern ships of the line. She was the first electric-driven battleship. She was 824 feet long and carried an even dozen 14-inch guns. She was a mighty wonder to the landlubbers.</p>
        <p>Among my shipments in this phase of the cruise were John Netherhand Heiskell, publisher of the Gazette, Little Rock; H. W. Fitzgerald, of the Pontiac, Mich., Press; Robert Lee McKenney, publisher of the News, Macon, Ga.; H. T. Black, who had recently retired from the job of business manager of the St. Paul Dispatch; plus the already identified Armstrong of New York and Gaylord of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>We must have made about as strange team as our hosts had ever entertained.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="456" />Few of us had ever been to sea, and Armstrong alone knew anything about the Navy and its customs. For instance: A group of us was sitting in chairs on the quarterdeck, in conversation with the officer of the day, the ship's captain, and a half dozen other officers, on a hot afternoon. We guests had been asked to be at ease, as informal as possible, and were especially advised to avoid wearing coats or any restrictive clothing that might be suggested to us by the circumstance that our hosts were obliged to wear regulation white uniforms.</p>
        <p>We were taking our languid ease as the conversation droned on. I was tipped back in my chair, my white-shod feet resting on the white lifeline that encircled the deck. A seaman appeared, as if by mere chance, though I believe seamen do not appear by chance in a gathering of officers on the quarterdeck.</p>
        <p>One of the officers shouted at the sailor, reprimanding him in angry tones. The sailor merely saluted, murmured "Aye-aye, Sir!" and departed. I asked the officer what the poor fellow had done to bring upon him such wrath.</p>
        <p>"Why, he brushed against the lifeline! He knows better than to do that!"I removed my feet from that sacred line at once, stammering an apology.</p>
        <p>"That's all right; the Navy's guests can do no wrong. But a sailor knows that the lifeline is not to be touched, except when it is being cleaned or in cases of emergency."Again, during target practice, we were advised to chew gum for the ear drums, I tore off the gum wrapper, carefully tossed it overside, and others followed my example.</p>
        <p>One of the fall-guy sailors again appeared in the midst of the officers, conspicuously tossed a cigaret [sic] butt overside, and was
        <pb n="457" />similarly reprimanded. Again questions, and the answer:"He could get the brig for that. No one is permitted to toss anything overside. We burn our garbage and waste. It's an old Navy custom, dating from the sailing days, when a fleet or a ship might be traced by its garbage.""But no enemy bothers about your garbage or cigaret [sic] butts any more. Why isn't the regulation changed to conform with reality rather than tradition?" "That's a hard one to answer. It's just that way, and I suppose it always will be.""Well, I'm sorry I betrayed our course by tossing that gum wrapper overside. When Nature calls, may I urinate into your ocean?" "Yes, but not over the rail, if you please."We heard a great deal about Navy tradition. We were shown the operation of the sonometer, which indicated the depth of the water at all times by means of electrical impulses sent down and bounced back from the bottom. So I was puzzled when the sailor took his place in a projecting space near the bow, as we approached land, and began casting the lead, shouting, "By the mark twelve!" and "By the deep six!"Yes, I was told, the electrical apparatus was much more accurate, but tradition called for the casting of the line, for the manner in which the soundings were reported, and for the marks, such as pieces of leather and white and red rags, on certain parts of the line.</p>
        <p>Publisher Heiskell of Arkansas was, if possible, more of a landlubber than I. He was a man of 52, appearing ten years older, white-haired and wrinkled, speaking very deliberately and with this twang-drawl that is heard nowhere in its perfection except in Arkansas and a portion of West Tennessee.</p>
        <p>We were taken to the torpedo room by a lieutenant assigned to
        <pb n="458" />teach us as much as possible about the working of the ship. The officer, with the meticulous modesty of the typical Annapolis man when talking to civilian guests, explained the working of the torpedo so fully that a child could have understood. He did everything but fire the weapon for us, showing how the flame was started, in the small steam engine that drove the mechanism.</p>
        <p>Said Heiskell, "But Lieutenant, I thought the torpedo was driven by compressed air."This was said in the manner of a person questioning the information that had been imported, as though you might say to the ghost of Wilbur Voliva, "But Reverend, I thought the earth was round!" The force of the doubt was in no wise lessened by the drawl and the gradual rise in key, until the final work, pronounced "aa-uh," took on the proportions of a protesting whine. You couldn't fool this Arkansawyer. That was the plain implication.</p>
        <p>The polite lieutenant went all through the demonstration again, showing the signals by which the torpedo room gang was alerted, the successive orders, and the response to each. He particularly stressed the almost instantaneous boiling of the water in the copper tank, showed how the tube closed behind and opened in front, and explained that compressed air was used only in the gentle launching of the missle [sic], and not at all in its own mechanism.</p>
        <p>The company of supposed journalists was respectfully silent as the exposition was made this second time, and there was an appreciative murmur at its close.</p>
        <p>Heiskell, looking suspiciously over his glasses at the officer, said, with far more force and meaning than before, "But, Lieutenant, I THOUGHT 9pause) that the toh-pedo was propelled compressed aa-uh!"A third and a fourth time the demonstration was gone through,
        <pb n="459" />and then we were led to the ladders upward; none too easy a path for the elderly doubter to follow. The old fellow was rather badly winded when we reached the main deck, and had been obliged to pause for breath several times in the long climb. As we all gathered around our instructor to thank him for his clear demonstration, vigorously topping thesweat out of our eyes, the persistent gentleman from Little Rock tremblingly addressed himself to the officer, and in tones that might have been ringing if the voice had not bee affected by wear and tear, proclaimed, with emphasis that left no doubt that he was expressing his everlasting skepticism: "But, Lieutenant. I have Always Thought(long pause) ..... that toh-pedos were propelled by compressed AA-UH!"__________When I mentioned the dearth of writing people, actually writing on the job, I hardly thought it decent to include in that classification Mr. Frank Pitts MacLennan, owner and publisher of the Topeka State Journal. He was the only other Kansas in our party. He was then 69 years old, and the most voracious taker of notes and sender of words for printing that I have ever known. He wrote execrably, in the style of a small boy of a lost generation, repeating every phrase he could pick up from the officers [sic] and supposed celebrities along the way.</p>
        <p>Every word that he wrote in his sprawling longhand had to be sent over the ship's wireless, at Navy expense, and every word had to be printed by the poor slaves out in Topeka, to the great job of their competitors on Capper's Topeka Capital, and to the humiliation of the staff of the Journal.</p>
        <p>MacLennan was rich. He had not neglected to use his power as publisher to get into businesses that paid dividends. He was up to his ears in banking and many other profitable ventures in and about Topeka, and, like many other senile publishers of that period, was a director of the Associated Press.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="460" />But it was the considered opinion of the press on this voyage of civilized adventure that poor old Frank was not in possession of all his marbles. He had lost a wife, under distressing dircumstances [sic], two years earlier, and this was thought to have unhorsed him in an important sense. Anyway, he made a complete nuisance of himself. His many thousands of childish words, sent out from this expedition, he later published in a sort of book entitled "Four Weeks With the Navy." It is my recollection that nobody bought the book, but some copies were received as presents by important people.</p>
        <p>Frank Brett Noyes, publisher of the Washington (D.C.) Star, and president of the Associated Press since 1900, was the grand poo-bah of the press delegation. He rode truimphantly [sic] at the head of all professions, sat even higher than Paul Patterson at table, and scarcely noticed any of the rabble of little publishers. Most of us never even heard his voice, unless faintly, when he made a formal speech at a formal dinner. Noyes was one of the rich moguls of the newspaper business, largely because of wise investments in stable commercial enterprises. He was at this time 61 years old.</p>
        <p>I spent an hour on deck one evening with Frederick G. Bonfils, publisher of the Denver Post. His story has been told by Gene Fowler in "Timberline," and by many others, so that it is not needful that I go into it here.</p>
        <p>I was not alone with Mr. Bonfils, though he was a lonely man on this cruise. He had appeared before a Congressional committee the day before our sailing from Charleston to testify as to his part in certain events leading up to the exposure of the Teapot Dome oil scandal,
        <pb n="461" />which eventually sent a cabinet member to prison, disgraced President Harding and most of his close friends, and ultimately resulted in getting even Mogul Harry Sinclair into the federal penitentiary in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Most of the newspaper people didn't care for the wealthy Mr. Bonfils. Not, at least, while the clouds in Washington locked so sinister.</p>
        <p>The other person present during the moonlight conversation with the notorious publisher was his bodyguard, Volney Hoggatt, an Oklahoma farmer of gigantic stature who never left his employer's side. Many in our company thought Hoggatt was a nickname, referring to the tall Oklahoma's mode of eating. Soup was eaten by the swilling system, common among hogs. The tall man bent his head to the table, lips to brim of bowl, and, tipping the bowl slowly toward him, hogged it with loud intake breathing. Other food was ingested in much the same manner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonfils, on the other hand, was the bon vivant type, with waxed mustache, elegant clothes, and an overlay of what he believed to be French culture.</p>
        <p>In the course of our conversation, he enlarged upon his culture, the French pronuncaition [sic] of his name, and his extreme wealth. He described his palatial home, far up in the mountains, and told of the fabulously expensive roads he was building as approaches to this ducal palace.</p>
        <p>During the cruise we learned by the wireless service that our host, Secretary Edwin C. Denby, who had bade us an eloquent farewell, at Charleston, had resigned under fire, after the Senate had passed
        <pb n="462" />a resolution demanding his dismissal by the President. Denby was a low-grade politician from Indiana and Michigan, and was up to his ears in Teapot Dome oil.</p>
        <p>We spent a day watching the marines storm Culebra Island, and Briggs and I, standing on a mountain, were impressed when an aquatic tank rolled out of a mother ship, swan ashore, and tore up the mountainside, knocking down jungle growth and slitting blank rounds of ammunition in every direction. In our own inland manner, we speculated upon how much tax money this demonstration was costing.</p>
        <p>Lafayette Young, called Lafe, publisher of the Des Moines Capital, was 76, the oldest man on the voyage, not too sure of foot when sober, and seldom sober. He had been a war correspondent with Shafter's army in Cuba in 1898, had served a few months as appointed United States senator to fill in an unexpired tern [sic], and was a conspicuous duck in the puddle of Iowa politics. He was deferred to with courtly grace by all the Navy men, and seemed to have a grand time.</p>
        <p>Admiral Robert Edward Coontz, chief of naval operations, was the ranking Navy man with the maneuvering fleet. On expeditions ashore and at formal affairs in honor of the visiting press, he usually was flanked by a political chief on one side and Paul Patterson on the other.</p>
        <p>Pleasant A. Stovall, editor of the Savannah Press, who had been Minister to Switzerland during the First War to End Wars, was the most sociable among the elders on the junket. From Rear Admiral Frank Schofield we lubbers learned much lore of the sea and of the Navy.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="463" />He was an elderly gentleman, and had been inactive for several years, but was assigned to this operation as a sure goodwill getter.</p>
        <p>I traveled about in Haiti in company of a Marine officer in a military car. The mountain roads were narrow, but had been given a light coat of macadam by the occupying forces, to make military movement possible. We met many parties of mountain folk, leading pack asses that carried the meager products of the farm and jungle to market in town. If there were two asses to a family, one usually carried the bananas and other produce, while the waster rode astride the other. The women and children walked, barefooted, of course. These sorry marketing groups always got off the road and waited for the military car to pass.</p>
        <p>A group of naked women was washing family laundry in a mountain stream. The scene interested me so much that I asked the driver to stop while I took a photograph. As I aimed my camera, a small man broke from the group of women and came charging at me, down a rough slope. I turned to my military escort for protection.</p>
        <p>"Better get into the car," said the lieutenant. "I could shoot him, of course, but we've had orders, since this hullaballoo in Congress, not to kill any more natives for a while, unless we have to. Might cause more talk and a cut in appropriations."Another offer of a job came my way in the course of conversations with Walter S. Dickey, a millionaire sewer pipe manufacturer of Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="464" />Dickey had recently bought the Kansas City Journal, a conservative, old-fashioned newspaper that was had at a bargain price because it had been beaten to its knees by the strenous [sic] competition of the more intelligently and vigorously managed Kansas City Star and Times, morning and evening.</p>
        <p>Dickey, a corpulent, dignified gentleman of about sixty years, said he had been following my work in Wichita, and thought that, if we could get together on policy, I might be the man to take over the editorial management of his paper on a permanent basis. In the course of long discussions under the tropic moon, I learned that my new friend was much richer than I had supposed. We spoke of the competition that the Journal faced, and of the extremely expensive job ahead of it. I reminded the new proprietor that the paper would surely continue to lose money for several years, and that money must be spent lavishly for new features, larger a staff and new equipment,"Yes," my white-haired companion responded calmly, "I've been told that I might lose as much as a million dollars a year.""That is a fair guess," I said. "It would not be lost if we made good in the venture, but it would be a present loss, at least. It would be, in another sense, an investment in the future of the newspaper. But only if we worked wisely and hard.""Well," said Dickey, thoughtfully, "I could stand losing a million a year, but if the sewer pipe business should slump badly I couldn't stand such losses for more than ten or a dozen years."[sic] I assured him that the paper would be in the black or on the auction block in much less time than ten years. I suggested five years as the outside limit for losing publication, under proper management, and thought it might be cut to much less.</p>
        <p>He replied, "Five years at a million a year would suit me fine.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="465" />I wouldn't notice the loss personally, and I'd be proud to own a good newspaper."However, I learned that Dickey knew nothing about the operation of a newspaper. I was then employed by publishers who were in exactly that fix, and was not happy about it. I told Dickey a story about an experience with my publisher which had happened just before I left on this trip.</p>
        <p>I had established the practice of going over the day's paper with a pencil for errors in grammar, usage, good taste, and style. This I did the first hour of my working day. Then I wrote a sheet of suggestions, based upon the days errors. This sheet did not refer specifically to that day's errors, but merely gave pointers on style and English. It was mimeographed and copy placed on the desk of each reporter and copyreader.</p>
        <p>For instance, a typical suggestion: Never write that an accident victim received a broken leg and a possible fractured skull. No sane person would receive a leg, broken or otherwise. He would suspect foul play and refuse delivery, or even call the police. Neither would he receive a possible skull, fractured or entire. Say it this way: The victum [sic] suffered a fracture of the right leg, and possibly a fracture of the skull.</p>
        <p>As I explained to Marcellus Murdock when he visited my sanctum one Sunday afternoon, I was saving a certain number of copies of the mimeographed sheets, and, when they had accumulated to a respectable number, expected to have them bound as a style book for the guidance or reporters.</p>
        <p>"Good idea, Charlie," said Marcellus in the magisterial manner he had been affecting [sic] lately. "But, of course, I'd have to approve or disapprove everything in the book before giving permission for publication."
        <pb n="466" />"Why?" I asked, simply enough, "You don't know anything about news-style or practice, do you?""No, but I own the newspaper," replied my boas. And that ended my interest in improving the Wichita Eagle.</p>
        <p>The sewer pipe man heard me through with an amused expression, but made no comment, I had told the true story to test his reaction, but could note none. I didn't want any man without newspaper training interfering with my style book again, no matter how good his sewer pipe. However, Dickey continued to cultivate me, and we were close friends throughout the voyage.</p>
        <p>We were guests of the government in San Juan, Porto Rico, an [sic] during such trips about the island as we cared to take. I was in the personal charge of General George Warburton Lewis, chief of the Military Police organization of the Island. Lewis was functioning as a colonel at the time, but had held ranks up to and including general in armies of several tropical republics. He was a very tall, thin, heavily-boned man, wiry, and possissed [sic] of a natural talent for command. His army of black police, gaudily uniformed, worshipped him. He spoke Spanish fluently, wrote poetry and pulp fiction, and loved conversation.</p>
        <p>Vice-admiral Henry A. Wiley, a native of Alabama and a veteran of the Spanish-American war, was an inconspicous [sic] but likable character aboard the New Mexico. Observing me spending much time on deck, alone, reading or writing, he sent a personal note, asking that I have dinner with him in his suite.</p>
        <p>That was when I became acquainted with [sic] loneliness of high place. Although my host was only fifty-six years old, he appeared to me much older. He seemed immensely pleased to have a working newspaperman as guest. During the two and a half hours that I spent with him there was
        <pb n="467" />no one else about, except the waiter and an orderly who hovered in the background, outside the dining room.</p>
        <p>When my host spoke of his pleasure in having a civilian guest, I brashly remarked that he must have daily opportunity to dine with older and wiser men. He explained, somewhat sadly, that his rank made it mandatory for him to dine alone, almost always. In later years I met many high officers at sea, and found that loneliness was the great burden that most of them bore.</p>
        <p>A small delegation of editors, of which I was one, transferred to a destroyer for a quick look at various islands and towns. We visited, first, Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas, then ports in all of the Virgin Islands. After meeting many of the natives under the guidance of naval officers, I became curious about the origin of the name of the island group.</p>
        <p>I was referred to a scholar in the principal library, I innocently inquired whether the islands were celebrated for the virginity of their women.</p>
        <p>[sic] "quite the contrary," he replied, in a tired tone. Then he related how Columbus, coasting along past groups of charming islands on a certain day in 1493, remembered that he was discovering new lands.</p>
        <p>By his charts he verified the fact that these islands were new to him, and therefore to almost everybody. There were so many small and large islands that he felt he should name the whole group at one fell swoop of his quill, so he asked what day it was. It was the feast of St. Ursula, a remarkably holy German lady who was reputed to have been followed about town and countryside by eleven thousand girls, every one a certified virgin.</p>
        <p>When the Admiral of the Ocean Seas found this story in his Book of Days, he was amazed, as almost anyone might be. So he sat it down in his log that this group of islands, however large, was to be called
        <pb n="468" />Saint Ursula and her Eleven Thousand Virgins.</p>
        <p>This particular group, composed mostly of three islands, had been known as the Danish West Indies from 1733 until the United States bought it for cash in 1917, as a strategic move toward domination of the Caribbean for naval and military purposes. Besides the large islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, which we visited, there are about fifty small islands, all tossed in on the realty deal we made with Denmark,When the United States acquired ownership of the islands, there were conferences of the learned graybeards in Washington to determine how to find a new name for the group, since it would not do at all to have them called Danish West Indies any more. The old story of Columbus, St. Ursula and the troup [sic] of virgins was dug up, and the map-makers were officially notified that these were the Virgin Islands of the United States.</p>
        <p>President Hoover, somewhat later, referred to the group in public as America's Poorhouse. He was blatantly abused for that, as he was for most of his true public statements.</p>
        <p>Charlotte Amalie viewed from the deck of the destroyer, was one of the most romantic and unbelievable towns I had seen, up to this time. Rising from the harbor, tier upon tier, gleaming white and in many pastel shades, it took my breath away, or such part of my breath as had not already been taken by the killing tropical heat, without a wisp of air stirring.</p>
        <p>[sic] I spent most of my time while ashore by myself, as I did on many of our shore visits. Most of the editors and publishers wanted to drink, visit with politicians, or sleep. I climbed the steep hills, met many people, most of whom spoke no English, and got myself a heart attack about which I said nothing to anybody. I just lay down under a palm tree and rested until the trouble was over. But I was fairly sure that tropical islands were not intended for my permanent residence.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="469" />My bad eye was giving me hell, because of the sun-glare from the water. The pain was so bad one day that I had to accept and [sic] invitation to spend the afternoon on a submarine, away down below sunlight. Even then, the pain was considerable. I didn't enjoy the bottom of the sea as much as I did on later occasions.</p>
        <p>My host on a sightseeing trip from Fredericksted to Christiansted was a cultured black man named Thomas Ramsey, a merchant with international connections. He had a chauffeur who knew the roads and answered questions when my host adked [sic] where we were now had pointed out such items as the grave of Alexander Hamilton's mother, who happened to be unmarried at the time of Alexander's birth; considered a great pity by Virgin Islanders.</p>
        <p>Only after we had gone many miles did I learn that my host was totally blind. Glaucoma, caused in his case by sun-glare from the water under his office window, had done him in. He was a middle-aged man, and quite wealthy, which was not a normal state of affairs in the Virgin Islands at that time. He had gone to New York for an eye operation, too late. He said the New York oculist had wept when he told the patient, that a month earlier might have been time enough to save his sight.</p>
        <p>I began to worry a little bit about my glaucoma, out decided to consult that New York doctor who had wept. I never did.</p>
        <p>__________The most interesting person I met in Porto Rico was Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, a colonel in the army, and not yet recognized by the world at large as one of the greatest of American medical scientists. He was then fifty years old, appearing much younger, vigorous, with all the marks of a lone pioneer, driving himself toward accomplishment. Already he had solved the problem of anemia caused by hookworm in Porto Rico and other tropical islands.</p>
        <p>In few men whom I have met in much meeting of men have
        <pb n="470" />I found the genuine enthusiast, as the Greeks meant when they used that word, or its ancestor. The enthusiast, according to the original meaning of the word, has a god inside him, inspiring him, driving him on to do that which he, perhaps alone of all man, can do,That was Ashford.</p>
        <p>He had been an army surgeon in the Spanish-American war, and now was possessed of one ideaï¿½creation and promotion of an international center for the study and conquest of tropical diseases,I had only a few hours with Ashford, but both of us made the most of the time. I talked fast because I sought the inspiration of his agile mind. He talked fast because he realized he had a pupil who might be able to use printed words to forward the work in which he had enlisted all his powers. I was flattered when he said, at parting, that he wished we might have days, instead of hours, for our discussion. It is satisfactory to know, so many years after that conversation, that Dr. Ashford lived to see his dream, the Institute of Tropical Medicine, a going concern. He lived to see many of the diseases he had fought, almost wiped out. And he did not live to see the children he saved, flying in great clouds of airplanes to New York, to vote for Vito Marcantonio and join the relief rolls.</p>
        <p>Louis V. Monsanto was as ancient mariner with a long gray beard and a glittering eye. He operated, in a most liesurely [sic] manner, an establishment known as The Graveyard of the Ships, at Krum bay, on the island of St. Thomas. He was a ship wrecker, or technically, a ship-breaker. From all over the seas the dying ships came here to be torn assunder [sic] as junk, and this had been going on for generations. Along a stretch of ocean front Monsanto, during a long lifetime, had stacked the figureheads of the ships he had wrecked. He placed no
        <pb n="471" />value upon these things, but saved then because he liked them and because he couldn't tell them.</p>
        <p>Just before our visit the old gentleman had been found by a New York junk man, who had bought for a small song most of the figureheads. The individual items are still being sold in exclusive and expansive curiosity shops throughout the world, at fancy prices, and many an oil magnate has paid more for one figurehead for his lawn than Monsanto got for a shipload of them. He told me that he got enough to pay for his son's honeymoon in New York, and that was all he wanted.</p>
        <p>__________We disembarked in the Hudson river, in New York, on a cold and drizzly day.</p>
        <p>The landing boats were loaded to the limit with cases of rum, wine and whiskey, bought at bargain prices by the foresighted and bibulous editors and publishers, and there was no customs inspection. One of my friends had inquired of our ship's captain about this. The captain re-plied, "There will be no inspection. Every naval officer is a gentleman. His guests are presumed to be gentlemen."I bought only one bottle of wine, thinking to save it for any illness that might occur in our home,My wife met me at Des Moines coming homeward from St. Paul, She had news that did not exactly surprise me.</p>
        <p>"I bought a copy of the Wichita Eagle just now. Your name has been removed from the masthead as editor."The Klan had won. Victor had come home to take over the editing job, since his lame duck term was soon to end, and that Klan money was needed to keep the presses running.</p>
        <p>When I reached the office, Victor tried to induce me to stay, at an advance in salary, but without my name at the masthead. I resigned.</p>

        <p>The Murdocks were only a little shamefaced about their surrender to the Klan. Chiefly, they were afraid that they might lose the Catholic circulation, because the whole town knew the story. They lost it, to be sure, but that was a small item in the losses that piled upon them during the next few years. The surrender did not pay off.</p>
        <p>So here was I, at liberty, thirty-eight years old, with a wife and two young daughters about as far away from a market for my talents as Santa Claus would be in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Neither my wife nor I spent any time worrying. Victor Murdock had shown some concern about our welfare, in one of our final conversations. "But you have no job, Charlie?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"No, but don't worry about me, I'm thinking of going back to civilization."The conversations with Victor and Marcellus continued over a period of two weeks, but I refused to budge and they obviously had commitments which made it impossible for them to make any concession except an offer of more salary. They wanted to retain my service, but it was plain that any anti-Klan, anti-banker, anti-advertiser stuff would be policed by Victor. Victor did not like to work, having been a government career man. But he could act as dictator over a worker. For this situation I had no stomach.</p>
        <p>I called Kansas City, was invited to come over and talk with Publisher Walter S. Dickey. I spent several days in and about the Journal plant, observing the setup, and had some good conversation with the amiable proprietor.</p>
        <p>__________Our minds were worlds apart. Mr. Dickey was, I realized, a fine, substantial gentleman, honorable and just, but with no more notion of how to make a newspaper than I had about making a million dollars.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="473" />When Mr. Dickey outlined what he thought to be a policy, I said I could not be editor of his paper. There was no question about salary. It would be liberal, but I knew Walter Dickey until his death, after he had lost all of his millions, trying to run a newspaper. He made the best sewer pipe in the world.</p>
        <p>I met my brother Van while in Kansas City. He was still doing well in the law, and was specializing in oil lands in the Southwest, which required much research into the history of the Spanish in America. He looked at me curiously and said, "You mean to say that you quit your job, with a wife nad [sic] two kids to support?""Yes, it seems that I did just that.""And how [sic] you refuse a good job here in Kansas City?""Yes." "Well, as John said when you spoiled the wood chisel, I always knew you were a fool, and I thought you were a damned fool, but I never knew that you were a God-Damned fool."All of thid [sic] did not disturb me. I wired Briggs, in Cleveland, and had an immediate answer, ordering me to come at once. All expense of moving would be paid, and I was on Salary from the moment of the arrival of my telegram.</p>
        <p>We packed almost all of our household goods, sold items that were not the best, and were on our way.</p>
        <p>__________In Chicago we stopped at a small hotel, called Brevoort, where I had been staying when in Chicago, for several years. We had dinner in the hotel diningroom, and my wife got a bad dish of chicken patties. If it might do any good I would at this point intersperse a warning against chicken patties in hotels or other public eating places. I have seen them prepared, and they are dangerous to the digestion of a rhinoceros, because they are the very last combination that &lt;unclear&gt;can be made&lt;/unclear&gt;
        <pb n="474" />out of spoiked [sic] chicken meat.</p>
        <p>During the meal my wife had been losing color, and looking straight ahead, as if drugged. As we walked toward the exit, she fell on her face on the tiled floor, and the two children started to yell at a tremendous rate. But I could yell louder, and I called out the ancient formula: "Is there a doctor in the house?"A female doctor responded, recognized the hysterical condition of the children (not to speak of the husband and father), and put the unconscious patient into a taxi. Next day we caught the train to Cleveland by grace of a wheel chair, in which my wife was moved about.</p>
        <p>When my new employer, Briggs, heard of the situation, he installed us at the Statler hotel in Cleveland, made frequent inquiries about the patient's progress, and told me to stay away from the office for at least two weeks.</p>
        <p>There are many differences in employers, I have observed.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="XII">
        <p>In less than two weeks we had found a furnished apartment, dreary but livable, in Cleveland Heights. My wife had recovered sufficiently so as to be able to take on housework, and I reported to Briggs.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry you came so soon," he said, "I haven't a thing for you to do. Roy Pinkerton, whose place you are going to take as associate editor, is still here, waiting for transfer to the chief editorial offices in Washington.</p>
        <p>"I'd like to have you sit in with Pinkerton on the job for a week or so before he leaves, but the job in Washington is slow in coming into being. Suppose you use the first two weeks getting acquainted with our way of publishing a paper. It's quite different from the Kansas way, you know, and different from St. Paul? too. Would you mind working as a reporter, sort of undercover? I mean that nobody would know that you're here on a higher job, exept [sic] Max Cook, the city editor. You'd take assignments from him, and he'd know that you're not really a reporter. In that way you'd learn the routine here. That might be good for you in your future work here."Of course I accepted. I felt like a leach, doing nothing and getting full pay.</p>
        <p>The Press was righ [sic], making millions for its proprietors, the Scrippses and Roy Howard. Howard was in Washington, or traveling the globe. Old Man Scripps, founder of the Press, was aboard his yacht, trying to flee from himself as James Gordon Bennett had done before him. Briggs was making thirty thousand a year as editor, which in the Scripps organization, means responsible directop [sic].</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="476" />We had such a large staff that, as a reporter, I was completely lost and insignificant. During the two weeks of reporting I did not earn my salt. I was given no continuing assignments, since smiling Max Cook knew that it would be useless to tie me up with a running story when I might not be able to stay with it to the end.</p>
        <p>I interviewed Curtis Dwight Wilbur, who recently had been made Secretary of the Navy. Stalking him for the interview cost me two days and an uncomfortable night. Then I got nothing worth a dime out of him, because he had nothing worth a dime to give out. He made a ridiculous spectacle as he stalked about the hotel, about six feet six inches tall, in dark clothes and a silk hat, followed every step by a little naval aide, about five-six, dressed in resplendent staff uniform, with ropes of gold braid and a sword that rearly [sic] tripped him at every step.</p>
        <p>I was sent, on orders from Briggs, to West Virginia, to do a cleanup story on an impeached federal judge, who was about to stand trial. This was a policy story, requested by the Washington office, since the Scripps Newspapers wanted to put this judge off the bench for his pro-mineowner decisions. He was charged with being drunk on the bench habitually, and neglect of duty.</p>
        <p>I got the story easily, since hardly anybody in West Virginia liked the old fellow, came home, wrote it. It was set up, with art, forwarded to the Washington office, but never published. The brass had decided that the facts in the case were dangerous, perhaps libelous if not proved.</p>
        <p>A line squall off Lake Erie destroyed the neighboring town of-Loraine, and I longed to go on the assignment, since I always enjoyed disaster work. But it was thought that the assignment might run into weeks, including rehabilitation, and I substituted for reporters who were sent out there.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="477" />Meantime, Briggs took me to lunch at the City Club, a sort of intellectualized Chamber of Commerce, thoroughly divided into airtight cliques. He made me a member at once, and introduced me to the [sic] at the round table most notable for advanced thinking. Most of these men were vigorous liberals in that day, when liberal meant something. The hard-shell members dubbed this group the Soviet Table.</p>
        <p>By this time the word was leaking out that I was not hired as a reporter. Jack Raper, humorist, was invited with me to that luncheon, and that alone indicated to the staff that I would soon be an editor. Raper was the favorite of Briggs, and his councilor [sic]. He was the oldest columnist in America. He was wise, master of a bitter wit, knew personally thousands of taxi drivers, policemen, sewer workers, politicians, lawyers and clergymen. Of the latter he was critical, but when a priest or minister proved his Christianity, Jack was for him, and helped him raise money for his charities.</p>
        <p>Jack ran a column, "Most Anything," daily, and had done so since a short time after the Press was established as The Penny Press. He was the only one left on the paper who had been an intimate associate of hearty, drunken, ignorant, wayward Old Man Scripps. Because Briggs vouched for me on past performance in St. Paul, and because he had read some of my American Mercury articles. Jack accepted me at once as friend and companion. That friendship exists up to the writing of these lines, though age has retired the valiant old fighter.</p>
        <p>At the club I met a vigorous, tall, broad-shouldered man named Peter Witt. He was known as an expert in trolley transportation. He was inventor of the side-entrance car, with choice of pay-as-you enter or pay-as-you-go. It was a great improvement over the old type cars, and Peter received a royalty on every car made. So he was prosperous, if not exactly rich. He had been a friend and co-worker of the great Tom L. Johnson crusader for Single Tax and leader in a lifelong battle
        <pb n="478" />for public ownership of certain utilities, including the trolley lines. A statue of Johnson stood upon a broad pedestal in Public Square, and it was decreed that anybody might occupy that platform to preach any doctrine he pleased, forever. Witt had campaigned with Johnson, and had helped him and a lawless crowd of radicals to tear up the tracks of the street car company, one dark night. This was all history. Peter Witt gloried in it. He spoke in every political campaign at Public Hall. His language was often profane, vulgar and offensive to the finer tastes. But he was a torch for what he believed to be progress. He was still fighting the trolley lines.</p>
        <p>Witt took a fancy to me, with the reservation that I was too young to know anything, and besides, I had not known The Prophet.</p>
        <p>All of this was wine for my soul, which had been so cramped with foul air in Wichita. At last I had come among people who knew something as to what the score was. I had found a newspaper that did not knuckle down to the department stores utilities. Witt had no education or refinement, but I preferred him to smooth Bob Timmons, the Wichita utility man, just about Witt's size, who had tried to capture me in Wichita and had failed.</p>
