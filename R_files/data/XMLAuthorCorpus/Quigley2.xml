        <p>This text was prepared for use in the Irish-American West project of the Stanford Humanities Lab at Stanford University. The two principal goals of this project are (A) to bring the wealth of western Irish--American literary and historical writing to the Internet in a scholarly project and (B) to counter the existing eastern bias in Irish-American scholarship, by providing an online collection of primary source material and scholarly articles devoted to exploring the works of western Irish-Americans.</p>

        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 267" />There are one hundred and five newspapers and periodicals published in this city, from the daily morning and evening journals--the Chronicle, Call, Alta, Examiner, and Evening Post, to the Wine Dealers' Advocate. This shows that the people of San Francisco are given to reading. It is doubtful if there be a city on this continent so well provided with newspapers. Here we have a paper to every 3,000 souls of our city. The inhabitants of San Francisco, supposed to be 300,000, have more papers published for their instruction than the people of Denmark, a nation of 2,000,000 inhabitants, or Turkey, an empire of 30,000,000; while Russia, an empire of 66,000,000, has only a few more than three times the number of journals published in San Francisco. It is not alone, therefore, in riches, climate, luxury and hospitality, that San Francisco bears off the-palm from the "world and the rest of mankind." But in newspapers and periodical literature--and this without including the Jolly Giant or the "Dance of Death"--we are pleased to find that, connected with the most respectable newspapers, namely, the dailies and several weeklies, Irishmen hold important, if not the leading, positions.</p>
        <p>There is John Timmins of the Chronicle, Creighton and Mahony of the Post, Dan O'Connell, 
        <pb n="268 The Irish Race in California." />Cosgrove and Flyn, of the Mail. Connected with the Chronicle, also, are O'Brien, Lynch and Ballinger--able men, at their different departments--who are all of Irish birth or descent.</p>
        <p>The profit and popular approbation may accrue, as they generally do, to men who know little more than the art to count the money, and squander or hoard it. But the genius to conceive, and the judgment to express the idea in proper and forcible language, are sure to belong to some well educated but badly paid son of the Emerald Isle.</p>
        <p>And this is their lot, not only in California, but in the Eastern cities, and not only in America, but even in England and all over the British Empire. So that the vulgar reproach so often uttered by unthinking men, that the Irish are only useful for digging canals and grading railroads, is only partially true. It should be added by way of appendix, that the Irish genius and brains conceived and originated, Irish eloquence gave expression to, and Irish pens have written some of the most faultless compositions that ever appeared in the English language, either in the "old country" or here. Without going back to the days of Sheridan, Burke, Grattan, Goldsmith, Moore or Curran, or giving the history of Berkeley, the first founder of an American college, or Robert Fulton, the in- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 269" />ventor of successful steam navigation--confining ourselves to men of our day, will we not find the most famed of them of Irish birth or descent? Drs. Kane, Hays and McClure were Irish; so is McCormick, the inventor of the reaper; so is Phil Sheridan of cavalry fame; so is Marshal McMahon by descent, of which he is proud; so was Stewart the rich merchant ; so are our leading capitalists and miners, Flood, O'Brien, Fair and Mackay. In a word, if the Irish element by descent and birth was taken suddenly away from the organization of society, commercial and moral, it would be like taking one of the main wheels out of a watch. The machine would look well enough, but the motion would be slow and irregular.</p>
        <p>The mines would not be developed, the railroads would not be built, the newspapers would not be readable for dullness, and the churches would not be filled.</p>
        <p>America would find herself in the same predicament that ancient Rome was in without a "Menenius Agrippa," when her working citizens retired in a body to the "Mons Sacer." The proud and rich had their lands and their treasures, but those were unproductive for the want of the people, the plebes, whose labor increased their value. The lessons of history are all repetition. It is the same 
        <pb n="270 The Irish Race in California." />to-day as it was 3,000 years ago. Caius Graccus and Kearney, Coriolanus and Crocker, Nob Hill and the Capitoline, are analogous in the lessons of history.</p>

        <p>The Post-office of San Francisco is under the supervision of the Hon. James Coey, Postmaster. He is certainly of Irish origin, and fills the office with great credit to himself and satisfaction to the public. Faults have been found with the management of the Mint and some other federal offices, but none with the Post-office or the Custom House, both under the control of Irish-Americans, namely, General Coey and Thomas B. Shannon. The Deputy-Postmaster is William C. Dougherty, and in both Federal institutions there is a fair number of the subordinate officials of our race.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 271" />In the Post-office, beside the principals, are-- Jackson, Owen, Crowley, Cassin, Mitchel, Butler, Hunt, White and others, all men of character. And in the Custom House are--Florence McCarthy, Redington, Ford, Clarke, Coey, Naughton, Laughlin, Mahony, O'Neil, Bulkley, O'Donnell, Moran, Kelley, Reynolds, and many others whose ability and character reflect honor on the Collector to whose judgment their appointment is owing. Had the Mint been presided over by such men as the Collector and Postmaster the disgraceful developments recently exposed, under the neglectful or criminal connivance of La Grange, could not have taken place.</p>
        <p>As a general thing the Federal officers of this State are men of character and integrity, from General McDowell, Commander of the United States army, Commissioner O'Bierne and John M. Coughlan, to the humblest officer in the department.</p>
        <p>THE MINT alone appears to be mismanaged, but this has happened unknown to, and without any concurrence of, the numerous subordinates employed in it, numbering over three hundred, a fair proportion of whom are Irish. Federal appointments seem to be at fault in this respect, that men are placed in responsible positions from their 
        <pb n="272 The Irish Race in California." />potitical influence, without any consideration as to their private character for honesty and morality. Men who could never get into power or position by the votes of their fellow-citizens by reason of their loose manners, such as having repudiated their lawful wives or being notorious libertines, get appointed through the influence of some Senator or Congressman or place-holder as corrupt as themselves. Surely men that are dishonest in their private lives cannot be expected to be trustworthy in their public official stations. Hence, strict enquiry should be made into a man's antecedent life ere he would be elevated into a position of trust under the government. This is not the case, however, for it is notorious that men who are divorced from their wives, aye, and even men who served a term in the State Prison,* are trusted with confidential positions under the government and under corporations, when honest men are refused employment or a chance to earn an 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 273" />honest livelihood. This state of things will always lead to fraud, peculation, plunder and disgrace, and, if not reformed, will lead to further evil. If President Hayes, who is an Irish-American, changes this manner of chronic abuse in the civil and military service of the country he will render himself honored and respected by all decent people, at the same time that his reformation of civil service abuses will add another proof the incorruptible integrity of our old Irish race in all parts of the world, as well as on the Pacific Coast!</p>
        <p>Of the Legislative delegation, more than one-half of the members elected and holding over in the State Senate are Irish-Americans. Five of the Murphys are in the Legislature--three in the Senate and two in the Assembly--B. D., P. W., and John C. Murphy in the Senate, and J. E. and R. W. Murphy in the Assembly, all men of ability and high social position and education; while we have McCarthy, Nunan, McKoppin [sic], Dean, Coleman and 
        <pb n="274 The Irish Race in California." />Donovan, and other names of unmistakable Irish orthography among the Senators, and Conway, Tobin, Gildea, Gough, Swift, Conolly, Hart, Dixon and a host of others of Irish descent, in more popular branch of the Legislature. It must be borne in mind that the members of the Legislature, of Irish birth or descent, are not all elected in districts where their countrymen are in the majority as happens to be the case in some electoral districts in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Hon. Bernard Murphy has been elected from San Jose, and his brother, P. W. Murphy, from San Luis Obispo, and J. E. Murphy from Del Norte, where the Irish element is far from being in the ascendant, and the majority of the constituents of those gentlemen were citizens of different nationalities, and neither by birth nor descent of Celtic stock,This is the case certainly in Del Norte, where Irish settlers are few indeed; and the Hon. J. O. Murphy's chief elements of success were his talents, his education and his honesty.</p>
        <p>These facts are highly creditable to our countrymen, as they are also evidence of the enlightened liberality of the people of California, who are apt most generally to give their suffrages to the most worthy. Prejudices there exist, deep and wide- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 275" />spread, against our people, especially among those whose ideas are inspired by sectarian rancor; but among the commercial and educated portion of the community distinctions of creed and country become every day more obsolete and discreditable.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that the Irish should be envied for the conspicuous position they occupy as statesmen, merchants, capitalists, legislators, miners, bankers, farmers and owners of real estate, and this in the face of very great opposition. Our countrymen had the press, the sectarian pulpit and the nativist movement--legitimate offspring, of Anglo-Saxon hate---against them. Yet, without secret societies or aid associations, and with nothing but their stout arms, and a simple but confiding faith, they own not far from one-half the real estate of the city, control, in a marked degree, the legislation of the State, are most successful in business, and last, though not least, fill the churches. If in its youth--in its cradle, as it were--our immortal race, like another Hercules, strangled so many venomous reptiles, intent on its destruction, including bigotry, the hostility of a hireling press and Know-nothing conspiracies, and all this in twenty-five years, what triumphs of our people will those see who will live for fifty years hence on these Pacific coasts!</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="276 The Irish Race in California." />THE FIRE DEPARTMENT of San Francisco, organized in 1866, is an active and efficient institution. They have a force of two hundred and fifty men, eleven fire steamers, and fifty horses. The men are paid salaries and are ready at a moment's notice to run off to any part of the city where a fire alarm calls them. They use eleven hundred and forty hydrants, over twenty thousand feet of hose, and draw water from fifty cisterns besides the hydrants.</p>
        <p>Among the Fire Commissioners are--William Ford and Edward Flaherty, and the officers are--David Scannell, Chief Engineer; Matthew Brady, James Riley, John E. Ross and W. Corbell, Assistants; Samuel Rainy, Jas. Stoddart, Peter Burns, Wm. Smith, Chas. Lyons, John McCarthy and John Wills.</p>
        <p>The expense of the entire force, including salaries, stationery, offices, running expenses, and hydrants, is about $242,000 a year--a moderate sum comparatively when it is considered how much the very existence of the city depends on the Fire Department.</p>
        <p>It is remarkable that most of the men are Irish-Americans, perhaps nine-tenths of them. And the reason is obvious, for firemen have to be vigilant, laborious and brave, and always 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 277" />ready for emergencies; besides their pay is moderate and the employment is not without danger. Indeed, the fire companies occupy as honorable a position as the army, if not a more useful one, for the object of their services is to save and not to destroy, and their discipline is as exact and the dangers they encounter are often as great as those which soldiers undergo in campaigns and sieges. The disgraceful notice, "No Irish need apply," which in civil service is often flaunted in the face of our countrymen, is of no avail with officers of the Fire Department, no more than in the United States army.</p>
        <p>THE POLICE FORCE of San Francisco is limited to one hundred and fifty men, officered by a chief and five captains, whose salary is $1,800 a year, while the men are paid $1,500 each. They are a respectable body of men, who discharge their duties faithfully. The one-third, if not the one-half, of the force are Irish-Americans, and if their salaries are high in comparison with those of eastern cities, their labors are correspondingly severe. It is allowed on all hands that the policemen of San Francisco perform the work of twice their numbers in any of the eastern cities.</p>
        <p>THE STREET RAILROADs of San Francisco are many, and traverse the city in all directions. Some 
        <pb n="278 The Irish Race in California." />of these, like the Market Street, projected and partly built by Peter Donahoe and the late Thos. Hayes, were organized by Irishmen. Several of the superintendents, as Michael Skelly, Esq., P. H. Canavan, Esq., are Irishmen, as well as about one-half of the conductors and drivers, who receive but $2.50 a day, and who have to work from an early hour in the morning to late at night.</p>
        <p>The inventive genius of our native artists have contrived many ingenious methods to compel their agents to be honest. "Lock and keys," and straps and registers, have been patented to keep the men from stealing while all reliance on principles of honor, morality and religious responsibility are entirely ignored. A large capitalist has been heard by the writer to remark that he "would prefer a 'smart rogue' in his service to an 'honest fool.' He did not care what his principles were," he said, "he would keep him honest by means of lock and key and other patented contrivances." What could be expected from this "lock and key" morality but what we see developed in the transactions of every day, namely, fraud, peculation, theft and dishonesty? If we have no confidence in a man's honesty but what is ensured by "lock and key" is it any wonder that he exercises all his ingenuity to demonstrate that his contrivance of "lock and key," 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 279" />though patented, is and shall prove a failure? This "lock and key" contrivance is worthy of the genius of what has been called soulless corporations, and demonstrates a low type of morality, in spite of schooling.</p>
        <p>Five steam railroads terminate or have their starting points in San Francisco and Oakland.</p>
        <p>THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, from this city to Ogden, in Utah, which cost, with its branches, about sixty millions, and earns about eight millions net profit annually. The road is valued at one hundred and eighty millions. This is a vast corporation, and affects the prosperity of the state in a remarkable manner.</p>
        <p>Next to this is the SOUTHERN PACIFIC, running to Los Angeles and eastward from there toward San Diego and Arizona, in all a distance of about seven hundred miles. This road cost about thirty millions of dollars, and it earns about two millions annual net profits.</p>
        <p>There are, besides these two gigantic corporations, the California Pacific, the San Francisco and North Pacific, and the North Pacific Coast Narrow Gauge.</p>
        <p>All these roads and their branches are under the management of the Central Pacific, except the North Pacific and the Narrow Gauge. The Cen- 
        <pb n="280 The Irish Race in California." />tral and Southern Pacific Railroad officials have caused numberless pamphlets and brochures to be printed and put in circulation, with a view to increase the traffic of their roads. But these pamphlets are unreliable and their statements made to deceive. They display an array of figures which "don't lie," as cant has it; but if figures don't lie they steal by subtraction and addition, and many poor immigrants find out when too late that the "figures" of these railroad corporations are the most barefaced offenders in their statements.</p>
        <p>For instance, in page thirty-six of a pamphlet published by the C. Southern Railroad, the writer, one Madden, states that "wages are higher in California than in any part of the world," but he does not say a word about the tens of thousands of men who can get no work at any wages, and this state of things is owing principally to the heartless conduct of the railroad monopolists, who employ Chinamen to the exclusion of all the white men they can dispense with. It is true, the section men who oversee the Chinamen are all white men, and the vast majority of them Irishmen. But these would not be employed if the companies could get Chinamen or any other men as faithful and competent as Irishmen. These bloated corporations take care, also, to state, through their hireling 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 281" />scribe, that the "company do not give free transportation to men who have bought land, nor after purchase does the company transport themselves or their furniture free." Oh, not they, unless they be Chinamen who work for half wages, and whom "the company prefers," according to the sworn testimony of one Crocker, to Irishmen, and even to poor native Americans! Behold what a liberal return they make for the vast quantities of land which the people presented to them to enable them to build and equip their roads. As soon as the roads are built and in running order, they dismiss every white laborer that can be got rid of and employ Chinamen in their place! Nay, they print and publish pamphlets calculated to impose on the poor Eastern farmer or laborer, by inducements held out to them to immigrate to the land of plenty and gold. But when they get the emigrant here, they refuse him a day's work, in order that they may thus compel him to return back again, and in this manner to get the last dollar he had, into their remorseless coffers.</p>
        <p>These railroad corporations are unquestionably the greatest hindrance to the progress of the State, for they not only control traffic, but sap the very foundations of the independence of the State, by controlling the Legislature. All private enterprise 
        <pb n="282 The Irish Race in California." />is paralyzed, and a wholesome competition obstructed by the jealous cupidity of this vast monopoly. If a steamboat begins to run on the Sacramento or any of its tributaries or bays, the "Central Company" immediately purchases, or runs opposition to this craft, or runs it down. If a stage coach, or an express wagon, or any sort of vehicle dares to compete with their extensive network of transportion [sic], these corporations run them off.</p>
        <p>There is no such monopoly in the civilized world, and there is not a government on earth would tolerate for a day such an incubus on the property of the people as the "Central Pacific Railroad" and its dependencies. They want the money of white men to purchase their lands at prices one-half above their value, but they don't promise them a day's work on their roads even if they should starve, nor will they transport them or their baggage at reduced fares after they have pocketed the immigrant's money. It is really candid of them to tell this. If men will be humbugged, let them blame themselves. They may form an opinion of how they will be treated by the railroad people from the sworn testimony of their leading men, who declared that China heathens were far better men and cleaner, and more 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 283" />truthful than any white poor trash. They might have added--but they supressed this--that they found China men, and women, too, more accommodating than those despised people, who would soonerof the vice which renders Chinese service so useful in the eyes of railroad magnates.</p>
        <p>If any one circumstance more than another could show the illiberality of the Central Pacific Railroad it is the well-known fact that during the Centennial celebration at Philadelphia its money-proud directors refused to make a reduction of one dollar from their usual rates of fare to those who were willing to witness that national celebration when all the railroads in the United States and Canada reduced their fares by one-half. Blinded by a gross avarice, possibly they did not see that their greed injured them financially, but with a contempt for public opinion, and a tyranny always the accompaniment of suddenly-acquired wealth, they obstinately refused to accommodate thousands who would have visited Philadelphia, had a reduction been made in the fare. Our candid advice, therefore, would be to our countrymen to settle anywhere in California, rather than on railroad 
        <pb n="284 The Irish Race in California." />lands, especially those sections under control of the Central Pacific and its branches.</p>
        <p>The Northern Pacific--principally owned, we believe, by our countryman, Peter Donahue--is conducted on different principles. He could never rival the others in meanness, nor approve of their insulting distinctions in favor of Chinese in preference to other nationalities.</p>
        <p>Let the conduct of the Northern Pacific Railroad of Minnesota and Dakota be compared with that of the Southern or Central Pacific corporations, and the difference in their treatment of their patrons, the immigrants, will be instructive. The Northern Pacific not only conduct purchasers of land from the Company free over the road, but brings lumber to build their houses, and their agricultural implements free, also. Not only this, but at every large station--say one hundred miles apart on their road--there are large houses erected with stoves and other furniture, where immigrants and their families can lodge free, and rest themselves for weeks if they wish. Fire-wood is also supplied them gratis, and all conveniences to wash clothing, and cook. This is the way that the Northern corporations are compelled to provide for the comfort of the people who granted them the privileges and franchises they enjoy. The 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 285" />California railroads, how do they compare with the liberal treatment of immigrants by the northern corporations? Do they house, feed, or carry them free or give them work? No; all they covet is their money, and when that is spent they may go to the poor-house, if one is near, or die on the parched plains.</p>
        <p>There are other railroad lines, such as the road from Oroville to Marysville, Yuba County, and the narrow-guage from San Jose to Santa Cruz, as well as the roads under the direction of Peter Donahue, to which the statements we are compelled to make in the interests of truth, do not apply.</p>
        <p>If these things happen, and that they do is unquestionable, why is not the voice of the press heard loudly denouncing these monopolizing corporations? Why is it that at election times the railroad candidates are known, voted for, and recommended as worthy of confidence and elected?</p>
        <p>If any other corporations, such as churches or religious communities, or clergymen interfered in elections the entire press would be unanimous in denouncing such intermeddling as wrong and not to be tolerated. Why is it that the press, like a chained Cerberus, is silent, when irresponsible railroad corporations invade the province of free government, and attempt, Phaeton-like, to sieze on 
        <pb n="286 The Irish Race in California." />the reins of the car of State, and run it to destruction? If a poor man steals a loaf of bread, or a miserable man gets drunk, the voice of the press is heard in harmony calling for his arrest, and sonic judicial Radamathus consigns him to a dungeon from which he emerges ten times more wicked and wretched than he was at first; but when railroad corporations plunder the people of millions' worth of property, and consign thousands to misery and suicide by circulating false reports, where is the newspaper bold enough to denounce such cruel conduct, and why is it that the press is silent? Some think it is explained by this mild word, SUBSIDY--not bribery--that would be too harsh a word. It is mere subsidy, which, more powerful than the waters of the Lethe, or the vapors of Hellebore, causes those vigilant public sentinels to sleep and be silent on the misdeeds of rich railroad corporations and other public plunderers.</p>
        <p>Though reluctlantly [sic] compelled to condemn the policy of the Central railroad people in the treatment of the white laboring class, we acknowledge the courtesy of many of the officers of that corporation, who are by no means individually responsible for the action of the executive officers in their corporated capacity.</p>
        <p>S. S. Montague, Esq., Major Redding, and others 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 287" />connected with the road as engineers, are cetainly [sic] men of refinement and humanity. A vast amount of the road-masters and foremen are Irish, for, as the Chief Engineer remarked, "wherever responsibility and danger are to be encountered there Irishmen are at home."Road-masters have charge of one hundred and fifty miles of road, and must be steady, sober men, as well as skilful in the construction and repairs of the road. There are Flanagan, Griffin at Carlin, Gavan at Terrace, Casey, O'Gara at Tulare, Monaghan at Stockton, and the two Mullens, with Fitzgerald, near Yuma, Fogarty and Laws at Blue Ca$on, Hare at Truckee, Mills at Winnemucca, Fitzgerald at Ogden, O'Gara at Caliente, J. J. Tracey at Los Angeles, John Mullen at Vallejo.

We will venture to say that more responsibility 
        <pb n="288 The Irish Race in California." />attaches to those road-masters and overseers, and that the safety of trains and passengers are more within their keeping than of any other class of men employed by the corporations, and that it is this impression--that they are the most reliable men and the best for the important duties that they discharge with such fidelity--which compels the Central Company to employ them in preference to all other people. This is highly creditable to our people.</p>
        <p>Many of the higher officers of these roads, such as Montague, Redding, Madden, and even the aristocratic Crocker himself in spite of his prejudices, are Irish or of Irish descent. But we prefer to chronicle the merits of the humbler of our countrymen to offering incense to the vanity of men who, while accidentally prosperous, would ignore their origin or the land of their nativity.</p>
        <p>There was one man, however, connected with the engineering enterprise of this coast who was an ornament to his profession and of whom his country was and will ever be proud. That man was Joseph P. Ronayne, late Member of Parliament for the city of Cork. He was a native of Youghall or its suburbs, and his family were old and distinguished in the history of the island. He was a graduate of the Queen's University of Ire- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 289" />land, and spent several years in California, engaged principally in planning and constructing the Truckee Ditch, one of the masterpieces of practical engineering of this continent. After discharging his contract with the company of capitalists who sent him out to superintend the work, he returned to his native land, and was elected, almost without opposition, to Parliament on the national platform.</p>
        <p>His eloquent speeches and bold sentiments created astonishment bordering on alarm in the British Parliament, and the people hailed him as a national leader, for he gave expression to sentiments calculated to inspire them with hopes for the speedy amelioration of their condition. But alas! in the spring of his career as a statesman, and at the moment that the national expectation was at its highest point, he died, after the amputation of a leg, deemed necessary on account of a hurt he received in California!</p>
        <p>This name was famous in the earliest date of Irish history. There was a St. Ronan in the seventh century, and also a King of Leinster in the same century; another Lord of Airtheara, same date. The celebrated inscription on the tombstone of Mont Callan, County of Clare, bears testimony in regard to the 
        <pb n="290 The Irish Race in California." />antiquity of this old Irish name. It reads substantially--Translation--THE CHURCHES AND MEETING-HOUSES of San Francisco, great and small, are about one hundred--eighty-six of all denominations (Jewish, Chinese, Russian, Spiritualist, Swedenborgian and other Protestant churches), and fourteen Catholic churches, exclusive of ten chapels. Some of the Catholic churches are crowded at from five to eight services every Sunday, and can thus accommodate from seventy-five to one hundred thousand worshippers, the services being always crowded, whereas the sectarian churches are seldom well attended, except where there are "smart preachers," like Drs. Kalloch, Scott, Guard, Hemphill or Platt, and the services are seldom but two on a Sunday, and always at hours to suit fashionable people.</p>
        <p>The number of associations, local, religious, national, military, literary, temperance and nondescript, from the "Jannissaries of Light" to the Ivy and Oak Leaf Club, are hard to count.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 291" />The number of such clubs, circles, veriens, and other societies, are about six hundred!</p>
        <p>Our principal Irish-American associations are the Father Mathew Societies; the Irish-American; Knights of St. Patrick; Knights Of the Red Branch; Sons of the Emerald Isle.</p>
        <p>In connection with civil engineering, we must not omit to give a conspicuous place to Jasper O'Farrell, Esq., the first City Surveyor and Engineer of San Francisco. Mr. O'Farrell was a native of Wexford, anciently Logh Carmain. The O'Farrells were a very old and respectable clan, and were chiefs of Conmaicne, which comprised formerly Longford Co. Jasper O'Farrell came to California long before the "Pioneers," and was employed by the Mexican authorities as a reliable surveyor, in whose maps and measurements great confidence were placed.</p>
        <p>In 1839, Juan Voiget made a survey of the site of Buena Vista, but in 1847, O'Farrell, under Alcalde Bartlet, laid out the plan of the city as it is at present located.</p>
        <p>In all disputes about lots, Mr. O'Farrell's decisions were final, and he was the authority in such cases up to the day of his death. He left a family of ten children, to whom he gave a good education and who are in good circumstances and one of whom, 
        <pb n="292 The Irish Race in California." />William, occupies his father's extensive estates in Sonoma County. Mr. O'Farrell was well known throughout the State, and filled several offices of public trust.</p>
        <p>In 1862, he got the nomination for Lieutenant-Governor of the State, but was defeated by J. F. Chellis, by a small majority.</p>
        <p>The following is from the public journals at the time of his death:One by one the heroic and enterprising men who are identified with the foundation and growth of San Francisco are passing away and leaving behind them a memory which must endure as long as this city shall sit by the Golden Gate. The last to go was the Hon. Jasper O'Farrell, who expired suddenly of heart disease Tuesday evening. He had just bade good evening to a friend, with whom he had been conversing, and sat down in a chair, when it was observed that he had lost consciousness. Those who were present thought it was a mere fainting fit which would soon pass away, and the usual simple means to relieve him were hastily adopted, but most unfortunately without success. Insidious heart disease, which suddenly calls away into the shadow of death those who are apparently robust and in good health, had its merciless clutch upon him, and in a 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 293" />few moments he was a corpse. Kindly and courteous toward all, of irreproachable character and career, endowed with all the humor and geniality of his race, Jasper O'Farrell was a favorite with everyone who knew him. Had he been of a grasping or avaricious disposition he might have been one of the wealthiest men in the State; but money, as such, was scarcely an inducement to him, and he died possessed of no more than a moderate competence. Come of an ancient and honorable stock in the old country, he had all the virtues of which his native land is proudest. The grandest monument to him is the great and prosperous city of which he may truly be said to have been the founder. The following too brief notice of his life we take from the Examiner: R. I. P.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Farrell was a native of Ireland, fifty-eight years of age, and received a thorough education in Dublin, as a civil engineer. He was a pioneer of California, having arrived in this State Oct. 20th, 1843. He settled in Sonoma on a splendid ranch which he called Anally, the hereditary seat of the O'Farrells in Longford. In 1848 he, with W. M. Eddy and J. J. Hoff extended the survey of the city of San Francisco, which was commenced in 1839 by Juan Voiget. The price allowed Mr. O'Farrell and his co-surveyors for their labor was 
        <pb n="294 The Irish Race in California." />one ounce, equal to sixteen dollars, for every fifty vara. When their work was completed it was found that there was not money enough to pay for it, and that a sufficient number of lots could not be sold to meet the bill. Mr. O'Farrell followed his business for a number of years, and then took an active part in State politics, fighting under the Democratic standard. In 1858 he was elected to the Senate, to represent Sonoma County, and later was a candidate for the office of Lieutenant-Governor, but was defeated before the people. During the administration of Gov. Haight, he was a member of the State Board of Harbor Commissioners. O'Farrell Street was named after the deceased. He was a widower, and leaves several grown children. He leaves two brothers, Dr. John O'Farrell (who is one of the stockholders in Goodall &amp; Nelson's line of steamers), Mr. George O'Farrell, of Sonoma, and two sisters, Mrs. Wesinger and Mrs. Roche.</p>

        <p>OUR STATESMEN OF THE "INCLYTAE GENTIS." SENATOR BROD-ERICK, GOVERNOR DOWNEY, BELLEW McMANUS, COLO-NEL THOMAS HAYES, ETC.</p>
        <p>David C. Broderick was born in Ireland, though most of our historians (?) put him down as of Irish descent only, and came to California in 1849. It is a singular circumstance that compilers of biographies and memoirs of eminent men of Irish birth, during the past at least, try to make them out as native Americans, thinking, no doubt, that the subjects of their notices will be flattered by the honor of an American nativity. But every decent man will resent it as an insult to have his name and nativity divorced from "Erin, the mother of heroes and saints," in order that his adopted country should be credited with whatever honor he may have acquired by his talents or industry in this free country.</p>
        <p>Broderick's ancestors were Leinster men, and were probably of Danish origin, like the McAuliffs and many other prominent Irish families. His education was neglected in his youth, but he had, 
        <pb n="296 The Irish Race in California." />under cover of an ordinary exterior, a genius of no common kind. He was for a time engaged in keeping a saloon or drinking bar-room in New York, where thirsty politicians used frequently to assemble and discuss state questions, and lay plans, or "pipes," as the slang has it, for the government of the Republic.</p>
        <p>No doubt Broderick, while presiding in his "hall," was often disgusted with these inebriated "statesmen," who, over the foam of their beer or the steam of their punch, and under the clouds arising from their smoking tobacco pipes, regulated the politics of the hour or planned a successful political campaign. His genius soon became impatient to enter the political arena, and at the first opportunity he became a candidate for Congress from New York city. He was defeated, however, by a small majority, and soon after he determined to seek a home on the shores of the Pacific. After he resided little over a year in California he was a candidate for legislative honors again, and was elected to the State Senate. His parliamentary experience surprised everybody, and from his knowledge of legislative rules and customs he became President of the Senate. His next move was to get elected as United States Senator. His ample private for- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 297" />tune, acquired by the various industries which he successfully engaged in during the most prosperous period of California's development as a gold-producing State, enabled Broderick to shape the materials within his reach so as to contribute to the gratification of his ambition. Broderick was once defeated by a vote or two in obtaining the position he aspired to, but he returned to the political arena with renewed spirit and energy, and his numerous opponents soon found out that they had to deal with a master, instead of an apprentice. The more opposition he met with the more his talents and mental resources became developed, and those who imagined they could use him as a tool soon found out that a master hand guided every move he made on the political chessboard. Gwin, Foote and Terry--enemies of his from national prejudices--became his untiring opponents, and their rage, and that of their servile followers, became furious when they found Broderick elected to the United States Senate in 1856.</p>
        <p>Upon the Senator's return from Washington, where his talents were highly esteemed and his principles were of the most disinterested quality, he was again assailed by the wretched clique, who could never hope to emulate his fame in 
        <pb n="298 The Irish Race in California." />California, and one Terry made use of the most disrespectful language to provoke him. Broderick, though enthusiastic and impulsive, yet had a large stock of coolness and self-possession, and it was not until he was assailed on every side as pusilanimous [sic], by friends and foes, that, in an evil hour, he consented to fight a duel with Terry.</p>
        <p>The hostile meeting took place, and the noble-hearted man fell mortally wounded by a shot from the practised hand of his opponent.</p>
        <p>His death was lamented all over the Republic, and the scorn as well as the execration of all men have pursued his persecutors, not one of whom has ever risen to distinction or honor since the day of his assassination.</p>
        <p>After having written the above we saw the following paragraphs in reference to Senator Broderick, which we insert here in justice to his memory and to corroborate our own statements, except in reference to the native place of the statesman. We had it from the best authority, namely, his own lips, that he was a native of Kilkenny, Ireland. It is, however, now considered fashionable to claim every Irish-American of distinction as a "native of Irish or Scotch descent"--anything to rob Ireland of her glory when she has nothing else to lose: 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 299" />"EDITORS ARGONAUT:--In your paper of the 28th ult. there appeared an interesting synopsis of the life and times of the late D. C. Broderick. The writer (unlike some others who revel in belittling and vilifying the dead) seems inclined to do Mr. Broderick and his memory no injustice. On the contrary, in plain, manly language he depicted many of the noble traits of the great commoner's true character. The statement of his chivalric, inflexible, indomitable will would indicate that he knows whereof he speaks. There are, however, other statements made which, to the writer of this, as friend to the departed Senator, it seems but simple justice, should be corrected. It is said he was 'born to humble life,' 'bred to lowly occupations,' 'without books,' 'with little education,' and that 'he kept a three-cent dram-shop,' etc., etc. Mr. Broderick was the son of a mechanic, it is true, but his father, when a young man in Ireland, had given evidence of such skill and ability in his trade that he, with a few others, was selected by an agent of the American government, on recommendation of Payne, an eminent architect of that day, to come to America to perform intricate and artistic work in the interior of the National Capitol. Our Senator was born in the 
        <pb n="300 The Irish Race in California." />year 1819 or 1820. Never will I forget the day nor the occasion when, in 1859, he arose in his place in the Senate Chamber, and, during a a [sic] speech, pointed with pride and pleasure to the magnificent capitals and massive columns as part of the handiwork of his departed sire. That day stamped him the orator--the peer of any--the people's champion--the brave, bold tribune, who exalted the insulted 'mudsill' above and beyond the dignity of the aristocrat. 'Without books?' This was not so. He had books, and few private gentlemen's shelves held a better selection. There were not many who were more thoroughly posted. His knowledge was not encyclopedical, but thorough and profound. Burke, Sheridan, Pitt and Fox, and their contemporaries, he studied and admired. From Macaulay's miscellaneous works he could recite more, and better, than any man we had in this city in his day. Adam Smith's 'Wealth of Nations,' and, indeed, all the English standard authors, he read and fully appreciated. In American history and of American statesmen, orators, and politicians no man was better informed. He was a student, gifted with splendid memory, and, where required, his conversational powers led captive all with whom he came in contact. His great general knowledge was stored in the 'book 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 301" />and volume of his brain, unmixed with baser matter.'The writer of this would not misrepresent either, for he loved and esteemed both Mr. Broderick and James A. McDougal. Of the latter it was said that he read everything from the Book of Genesis to Aesop's fables, and as a lawyer had few equals. On one of those happy occasions of the past, at the Magnolia in Sacramento, Senator James A. McDougal said that, as a student and critic of the works of Shakspeare, Mr. Broderick had no superior in the State of California. He was not like theHe was not born of low parents. He was not without books, nor of little education. Loyola was a crippled soldier, and over thirty years of age when he took up his Latin grammar; yet no man did more for science and education than Ignatius. Broderick could mould men's minds, and with hooks of steel tie them to him. He had the wisdom to devise, and the courage to execute. Such men have saved nations. Even Jefferson Davis esteemed him; he, and those by whom he was surrounded, said that Broderick was made of stern stuff. Nor will Gwin, his ancient foe, who as bitterly opposed him as Scipio ever did Hannibal, 
        <pb n="302 The Irish Race in California." />deny but that he was a man of mind and intellect. We may ne'er see his like again. If he had been permitted to live, he, too, might have averted calamities which have since befallen our country. At all events, his high integrity would have tended to check the simony, malfeasance and corruption by which we have been dishonored as a people.</p>
        <p>He sought place, position and power that he might fearlessly advocate man's natural rights. Take him as he was, with his high and laudable ambition, and his noble attributes, he never in business conflicted with men whose aim was the acquisition of the glittering dross. Contrast him and his antecedents with your present Peter Funk banking magnates your present political swindling land grabbers, your peanut peddling leaders of society. Oh! what a contrast--'what a falling off is there, my countrymen.' He was the first and the last from the Empire State of the Pacific Coast who truly represented the chivalric heraldry of the race from which he sprung. Then let him rest in peace. D. M."GOVERNOR JOHN G. DOWNEY'S career as a statesman has been the most successful and brilliant that ever adorned the annals of California. The testimony of all parties, of whatever race or political complexion, is, almost without an exception, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 303" />that Governor Downey was the most prudent, independent and talented man that ever held the reins of supreme power in this state. We shall presently adduce the evidence of different witnesses testifying to John G. Downey's public and private virtues, in order to put it out of any man's power to insinuate that flattery has had anything to do with the well-merited encomiums which the simple truth compels us to pronounce on his popular administration of the government of this great State. It is Governor Downey's fortune to stand at the head of all our Irish-American statesmen of the present day, and in history, without a doubt, his name will stand next to that of General Jackson, by reason of his unswerving firmness, his disinterestedness, his integrity, and the general appropriateness and popularity of his public acts and messages. He was called to supreme power in a critical time of the commonwealth, and by his firmness and prudence he contributed materially, not only to the prosperity of the State, but most probably to the salvation and integrity of the Republic.</p>
        <p>It is a strange but not unusual occurrence in the history of our race that, in eventful times, when dangers threaten or difficulties stand in the way, there and then scions from that "old stock" are 
        <pb n="304 The Irish Race in California." />called to supreme authority to make sure that "the Republic should suffer no injury,"--Ne quid detrimenti Republica capiat. Then the real heroes are called forth by popular voice, like Hercules, to subdue monsters and conquer tyrants, like Jackson beating back the red-coats at New Orleans or rebuking lurking secession in the South, or Downey vetoing the infamous legislation of a bribed legislature at the bidding of a bloated corporation. Irishmen are always ready to stand in the breach when dangers threaten. They claimed the foremost posts in danger and they got them.</p>
        <p>Before giving a brief biographical sketch of our statesman-Governor we give quotations from several journals of different political views, to show in what high estimation his gubernatorial acts were held by the people of California.</p>
        <p>GOV. DOWNEY.--"In looking over the vast political sea that has stormed and raged around the interests of our State since its organization, not one of those who guided her helm stands so pre-eminently before the people as possessing all the virtues and requirements of a skillful pilot, as he whose name heads this article; for under his control and management, the noble ship of state has touched more closely the haven of peace and prosperity than ever before. Coming into the position he occupies un-&lt;illustration&gt;GOV. JOHN G. DOWNEY.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 305" />der circumstances of a peculiar nature, he has fulfilled the duties of his high office with such Jacksonian ability; has proven the reputation accorded to him by his personal friends for inflexible honesty and integrity; has shown his deep and abiding interest in all matters connected with the State, and in his public documents, on matters of policy and otherwise, such purity of thought and language intermingled with a moral expression so impressive, as to win for himself the admiration, respect and esteem of his fellow citizens. All admit his popularity and excellence, and express the belief that no political party can present a name in connection with the next election for Governor that will raise such a shout of approval throughout California, as that of John G. Downey."--Spirit of the Times of Nov. 17th, 1860.</p>
        <p>Nothing that the most enthusiastic admirer of the Governor could write or say in his praise could exceed the foregoing testimony of an impartial and independent journal in his favor.</p>
        <p>In reference to the Governor's political message of January 1861, and the sound views of policy which it recommended, the expression of the press is in unison regarding the principles and measures it proposed for legislative action. The Evening Bultin [sic] of Jan. 18th said: 
        <pb n="306 The Irish Race in California." />"We publish in another page the message of Gov. Downey. The style is unpretending and plain, while there are many sound common-sense recommendations compressed in into few words. It is, however, that portion of the Governor's address which treats of Federal relations, which we think the best feature of his document. His remarks in that connection are patriotic, sound, and truly Californian. We hope the Legislature will be governed by his counsels, for he undoubtedly speaks the minds of the people." This, coming from no friendly source, speaks for itself.</p>
        <p>The Sacramento Union of same date, says:"The Governor's message is a good state paper. Governor Downey speaks like a patriot and a lover of his country, and his whole country. In our judgment, the Governor is eminently sound in his expressed views.""Taken altogether, the Governor's annual message is a creditable production."--Marysville Appeal.</p>
        <p>The Weaverville, Trinity Journal, said: "California has reason to be proud of the man now filling the executive chair. Through all the conflict of public opinion, through the heat and beyond the influence of sectional political organizations, through the spirit of partisan feeling, and against 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 307" />the moneyed power and pressure at the capital, for the passage of fraudulent schemes of legislation, he has stood bold and firm like a skillful mariner guiding the helm of the ship of state. His record will be a moving power in the hearts of the people, and a monument to the man who has on every occasion rebuked the importunities of political tricksters and self-constituted party leaders, and who dared to do right in the honest discharge of his whole duty.""[sic]The daily Stockton Argus, said: "The Governor's annual message to the Legislature is a clear, practical document. It comes direct to the gist of public affairs. His style is such as to elicit a desire for cool discussion--not angry debate."The testimony of the editors of the press regardless of party politics, is entirely unanimous in esteeming Gov. Downey as the best executive that ever presided over this State of California. He was truly a man of the people, and the right man in the right place; and had he been influenced by ambition, or coveted political eminence, there is no office in the gift of the citizens that he might not have successfully aspired to.</p>
        <p>But it was not on account of his elegantly written messages, overflowing with sound common sense and lucid with practical suggestions and classic 
        <pb n="308 The Irish Race in California." />phrases, that the Governor became popular; it was because of his honesty, integrity and independence that he became the idol of the people of California. His having so frequently refused to put his official signature to acts of hasty or vicious legislation, is what elevated him in the estimation of all men to the level of the greatest statesman of ancient or modern times.</p>
        <p>Two disgraceful measures had passed both Houses of the Legislature through bribery of a majority of their members. The "Horace Smith Change of Venue Bill" and the "Bulkhead Bill." Both these bills were vetoed by Gov. Downey, when, if he went with the current of a corrupt popular Assembly, he could have put millions into his purse.</p>
        <p>The Governor, with a sternness truly Catonian, refused all the overtures of corruption, and imprinted the indelible stigma of his veto on the enactments of a bribed Legislature. One Smith had murdered a young man named Newell, and, knowing that the citizens were justly incensed against him, he sought a change of venue, or wished to be tried elsewhere than in San Francisco, where he was known. The bill favoring this criminal's design passed the Legislature but was vetoed by the Governor, though it afterwards be- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 309" />came a law by a two-thirds vote of the members. The following are the expressions of the press in reference to the Governor's action:"As respects Governor Downey, there is no language we can command which will convey our exalted estimate of this good and great man's character. To have withstood the political supplications addressed to him touching this business, to have opposed, with his honest voice, a whole lobby and Senate House, full of his political friends, from honest convictions and impulses of simple justice, ranks him with the noblest lawgivers of antiquity and the most disinterested and purest of modern times. All honor to the people's protector and defender. All honor to the man that would see the laws equally administered to the rich and the poor, the high and the low."The Alta said: "By this act Governor Downey shows that in the discharge of his duties he is influenced by no considerations but those of the public good. The conduct of Governor Downey in this and in many other cases affords a striking contrast to the weakness and wrong-doing of many of his predecessors."Another paper, the Tribune, said: "The Governor has done himself immortal honor by his bold stand against an effort to override law and right, 
        <pb n="310 The Irish Race in California." />and his action will be sustained by the press and the people everywhere."The Morning Call said: "Yesterday Governor Downey performed an act of grace in vetoing the bill ordering a change of venue in the case of Horace Smith, but the measure passed the Senate over the Governor's veto. We shall have it, then, on the records of California, that, in this boasted land of equality, republicanism and universal democracy, there are classes of men more highly favored than are any of the so-called privileged classes of absolute Russia or less absolute Britain. It will be on record that our law-making power will make one law for the poor and another for the rich. Hereafter it may be set down as a fact that the poor man, without friends, who may be accused of crime, is to be visited with all the rigors of the law, while the rich man, with friends at court, will be afforded every possible facility to clear himself of the charges against him. The indignation we feel at such outrages against justice and equality almost impels us to adopt the conviction that secession and the process of dissolving a state of government under which such abuses can be openly practiced and tolerated has not commenced a moment too soon. Certain it is that political corruption has attained a terrific magnitude, and, if not 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 311" />soon checked, the last vestiges of the pretence of order and of the protection of the people will be swept away."This was the strong language uttered by the most influential, as well as by the most radical, press of the day, and will give a clearer idea of the difficulties which Governor Downey had to encounter and overcome than any amount of individual statements. The remarks of the Morning Call, the organ, at that date, of the most radical elements of the community, and the opponent of everything Irish, are valuable as the concessions of an enemy in regard to the course and conduct of the Governor.</p>
        <p>In reference to the veto by the Governor of another measure of vicious legislation named the Bulkhead Bill and the Omnibus Wagon Road Bill, the voice of the people, through the press and their municipal assemblies, are loud in his praise. They wrote:"He has been emphatically the people's Governor. If that bill had become a law, California would have been bankrupt long ago. In particular the people of this city owe a debt of gratitude to Gov. Downey which they will never refuse to liquidate. He has been our consistent, steadfast, and true friend. When some of our delegates in 
        <pb n="312 The Irish Race in California." />the Legislature proved untrue or lukewarm in regard to our best interests, the Governor came to our aid and saved us from plunder and spoliation. It was eminently fit and proper that our Board of Supervisors should take the method of publicly thanking him--which they did on Monday night. The following are the resolutions:'Whereas, John G. Downey, Governor of the State of California, by his firm and fearless conduct, officially displayed during the last late session of the Legislature of the State, in opposition to acts of that body detrimental to the rights and interests of our city, has merited the approbation and gratitude of the people of San Francisco; therefore be itResolved, That we, the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, hereby tender our sincere and fervent thanks to his Excellency, and that the President of the Board of Supervisors be requested to transmit to him a copy of this resolution.' No such tribute as that conveyed in this resolution was ever before paid by this city and county, or any other county in the State, to the executive head of the Government."The next and the last testimony we shall introduce in proof of the universal popularity of our 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 313" />fortunate Governor, is the following document, signed by the principal men of business of San Francisco, most of whom had nothing whatever to do with party politics. Here we have the signatures of Irish and native Americans, Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, English, and Scotchmen. Men, also, of all religious creeds; Hebrews, Christians, Catholics, Protestants, as well as of men of no creed, and all coming forth voluntarily with their voice and vote in favor of the integrity and heroic fortitude of the young Governor who was scarcely out of his boyhood, like the shepherd prince of ecclesiastical history when he dared to encounter, and to conquor [sic] the monstrous giants of corruption which obstructed the peaceful paths of legislation. The following is the document we refer to:"To His Excellency, J. G. Downey, Governor of California:SIR--The undersigned members of the 'Anti-Bulkhead Committee' of this city, desire, on behalf of themselves and other citizens, to tender you their most respectful and sincere acknowledgements for the great service you have rendered to the entire State, and especially for the people of San Francisco, by your veto of the Senate bill No. 167, which authorized the 'Dock and Wharf Co.' 
        <pb n="314 The Irish Race in California." />to erect a wall around our city. In common with the people of the whole State, we recognize in this act of your Excellency the proof of an inflexible determination to tread in the path of duty regardless alike of persuasions, temptations, and menaces; and when we reflect upon the audacity and power of that organization which has guided, if not controlled the legislation of our State, and realize that you have put a stop to its mad career, we are involuntarily reminded of that honest impulse and stern will which made Andrew Jackson the idol of the party to which he belonged, and embalmed his memory in the hearts of the people of the whole Union.</p>
        <p>But very few of us have any more pecuniary interest in the defeat of this enormous unparalelled [sic] scheme than is common to all the citizens of California, who are proud of the State they have helped to build, and are resolved to live on her soil and expect to sleep on her bosom. Yet the danger this measure threatened, not only to commerce, but to the liberties of the people, and to the public virtue; the principles it involved so subversive of our institutions; the gloomy shadow which its gigantic dimensious [sic] flung far into the future, all aroused our fears and conspired to enlist us among its opponents.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 315" />Some of us are proud to claim our descent from the same 'Green Isle of the Ocean' that gave your Excellency birth, and our hearts warm anew to the memories of that storied land, while we reflect, in this free home of our adoption, that Americans have chosen for Governor a brother Irishman. We crave indulgence if our language is too personal.</p>
        <p>Our joy and gladness are welling up from bosoms that are stirred to their inmost depths by that deliverance from great peril which we owe to to [sic] your official action.</p>
        <p>We wish you could have seen our city, over which the shadow of this giant monopoly has for months been creeping like the chill and torpor of death, when your hand lifted the threatening cloud, and joy and sunshine lighted up every face. Business was suspended, cares forgotten, men went about congratulating their neighbors, friends embraced and even strangers shook hands. We venture to say that never was a whole community more jubilant. The booming of cannon from many points, the waving of flags, and the cheering of applauding crowds of men, evinced the gladness that beat in the popular heart. And when night came on, in the silence of many a chamber where full hearts were pouring out their joy, upon you and yours were invoked the 
        <pb n="316 The Irish Race in California." />choicest blessings of Providence which overrules all things for good.</p>
        <p>That you may long occupy the place you have honored by your sterling integrity is the prayer of your sincere and attached friends,Fred'k McCrellish, secretary; B. Davidson, John Sime, Fred'k Billings, Abbot Dibble, Maynard, Wm. F. Babcock, Wm. B. Johnston, Geo. H. Howard, Noble Sage, Jacob Deeth, N. G. Partridge, Wm. J. Shaw, Delos Lake, G. K. Fitch, John S. Ellis, H. E. Highton, J. B. Thomas, J. A. Banks, H. De La Montanya, C. J. Dempster, John Shirly, Cornelius D. O'Sullivan, John F. O'Connor, Myles D. Sweeny, James H. Cutter, Eugene Crowell, John H. Bosworth, Jos. S. Paxton, Thomas H. Selby, A. S. Gould, T. W. Macondray, R. E. Brewster, J. R. Robinson (of Coleman &amp; Co.), J. C. Beideman, and several others.</p>
        <p>Having transcribed the foregoing at random from copious eulogistic notices of the Governor and his official acts during his term in office, in order to avoid the suspicion of having given an exaggerated account of his merits, we now hasten to conclude our imperfect sketch by giving a brief account of him and his ancestors in the past.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 317" />John G. Downey was born in Castlesampson, in the County of Roscommon, Ireland, on the 24th of June, 1826. Castlesampson was the inheritance and home of the Downeys during many centuries. Their estates were confiscated under the English penal laws, for the Downeys remained faithful to the old creed, but, though disinherited, they were not dishonored, and the representatives of the family retained their influence among the people.</p>
        <p>The Downeys, called, according to different styles of orthography, "o Dubhnaigh" or "ui Dubhnaigh," were distinguished and known to fame as early as the ninth and tenth centuries. Some were chiefs, others bishops and abbots, and were originally from the north, belonging to the "Kinel Eogan." There was one a celebrated Archbishop of Cashel in the eleventh century.</p>
        <p>The Governor's maternal ancestors were the Gateleys, who were of Norman descent, and were distinguished in Ireland for their high position and many virtues. The Gateleys were distinguished as clergymen, lawyers and engineers, and loved the land of their nativity with an ardor equaling that of the original Irish. These were again connected by marriage with the Johnstons, a name distinguished for the high standing and wealth of many of its members. The Governor, we find, 
        <pb n="318 The Irish Race in California." />therefore, was no "novus homo," having a combined stream of Celtic and Norman blood coursing in his veins.</p>
        <p>John G. Downey came to the United States in 1842, being then ten years of age. Though he passed through the course of studies given in the national schools of Ireland, where he acquired a fair knowledge of the sciences and the English grammar, yet judging rightly of the advantages of a classical education, he devoted two terms to the study of Latin in Maryland. Soon after he entered as an apprentice to learn the drug business, in Washington, under John F. Callan. His next location was Cincinnati, where, on account of his knowledge as a pharmaceutist, he readily got admitted as a partner with one Darling. His business in Cincinnati was prosperous, and he might have become wealthy in persevering in its pursuit, but the California popular movement, in 1849, was too strong for him to resist, and he started to the land of golden promise. He reached San Francisco early in 1850, where he at once engaged as bookkeeper for Henry Johnston &amp; Co., of Dupont street.</p>
        <p>In December 1850, he went to Los Angeles where he settled permanently, and having been elected to the office of County Treasurer, he de- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 319" />clined the honor on account of the fact that his own private affairs demanded all his care and attention. Notwithstanding his disinclination to politics, he was repeatedly elected City Councilor and Supervisor. In the year 1855 he was put forward as the champion of liberty and right, against the fierce opposition of Know-Nothingism and proscriptive secret organizations, and was elected by a handsome majority.</p>
        <p>Before this time Gov. Downey had no desire for politics, and was rather inclined to enjoy the "otium cum dignitate" of quiet life, of study and philosophy. But when he saw the dangers that threatened the State and civilization from a conspiracy of the most unprincipled members of the lowest and worst element of society, held together by horrid oaths and prepared for confiscation, rapine and blood, he flung himself into the front ranks of opposition to the treasonable Order of Know-Nothings, and instead of the office seeking him, as heretofore, he now sought office as the only standpoint from which a successful opposition could be made against the reckless aims of Know-Nothingism. He stripped himself of all private cares when he heard the call of the constitution for aid and defenders, and he never sheathed the sword of truthful debate until he found himself 
        <pb n="320 The Irish Race in California." />seated in the supreme chair of state, and from there he boldly rebuked and finally discouraged and blighted, by the exercise of a just but stern authority, all efforts of secret treason to obstruct the wheels of constitutional government.</p>
        <p>He became Governor in 1859, and his official acts, vetos, messages, instructions and proclamations form, as indicated by the extracts given above, one of the most pleasing chapters in the history of the State.</p>
        <p>Gov. Downey married, in 1852, Miss Guirado, a Spanish lady of rare accomplishments, and he was only thirty-four years of age when he held the reins of supreme power in the State.</p>
        <p>Governor Downey is to-day comparatively a young man, only fifty-one years of age, and, with his experience, ability and popularity, might reasonably expect and aspire to higher political honors than those already enjoyed by him. But, having discharged well the duties of his office as Governor, and being of a studious and philosophical turn of mind, he has followed in the footsteps of some of the greatest statesmen and rulers, such as Cincinnatus, Washington and Jackson, by retiring to his ranch to enjoy the peaceful life of a farmer, and entertain his friends at his hospitable board. Having served well his country he retired 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 321" />from the political arena, before corruption became an epidemic, with his robes of office unstained by the slightest speck of official fraud or dishonesty. And this is no small glory in these degenerate days.</p>
        <p>Before concluding this imperfect sketch of Governor Downey we must not omit to allude to the the [sic] style and composition of all his official writings, whether messages or proclamations. His annual message for the year 1861 is a model of pure English. In its well-rounded periods there are no superfluous words, but the style flows on like a transparent rivulet over a bright and pebbly bottom, making its music and its force clear and agreeable to the most superficial observer. There is no bombast, or cant phrases, or "buncombe" speeches, but sound views and statesmanlike suggestions are uttered in language of Attic brevity and sententious Celtic eloquence.</p>
        <p>Some of the papers, to make people believe that they were sound critics and judges of perspicuity of language, criticised the Governor's writings as "plain," when the fact was that they themselves, in their journalistic compositions, show a lamentable lack of all the constituents of elegant or even grammatical writing.</p>
        <p>Governor Downey, whether he wrote a message, 
        <pb n="322 The Irish Race in California." />penned a Thanksgiving proclamation or hurled a veto, like a thunderbolt, at a corrupt ring, never once forgot that he was a gentlemen, a scholar, a Christian and an Irishman.</p>
        <p>"The Portland Times republishes Governor Downey's excellent Thanksgiving proclamation as a literary selection. It is got up (written?) in good taste and breathes a spirit of devotion and patriotism seldom equaled in a similar document."--Marysville Appeal.</p>
        <p>In fine, if any man could be happy in looking back on his political career as a statesman that man is Governor John G. Downey.</p>
        <p>TERRENCE BELLEW McMANUS' memory claims a brief space in these pages. He was an early settler in San Francisco, having arrived from the Australian penal colonies in 1852, and if he was not renowned as a statesman like his countryman, Broderick, he was celebrated as a martyr and a patriot. There were few of the Young Irelanders truer nor more sincere in their love for their native land than McManus. He would have sacrificed his life with joy to serve his country, and he would have suffered the severest tortures to set her free, and erect her into a nation.</p>
        <p>The writer of this knew McManus well, and and [sic] often saw him promenading on the most 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 323" />public thoroughfares of Liverpool with the air of a prince, with a rifle on his shoulder.</p>
        <p>McManus was a native of Fermanagh, but was educated in Monaghan town, where his maternal uncle, Rev. Dean Bellew, was parish priest for over thirty years. His grandmother was a Spanish lady, whose hot blood seemed to have flowed in a large stream in the arteries of the young patriot.</p>
        <p>After having finished his education in Monaghan, McManus went to Liverpool, where he was largely engaged in a commission and shipping business. But after the French Revolution, in '48, and the stirring events which were passing on the continent of Europe, he engaged heart and soul in forwarding the revolutionary movements in Ireland among his countrymen in England. He organized them into clubs and provided them with military instructions and arms, in order to be prepared when "the rising" would commence. He made a trip to Ireland to consult with Mitchel, O'Brien, Meagher, and the other leaders, and was at Ballingarry when the "fiasco" at the widow McCormac's took place. He witnessed with grief the dispersion of the brave peasantry who came in thousands to be ready for the "fray," but for whom there 
        <pb n="324 The Irish Race in California." />was no provision made as regarded food or arms. There was neither commissariat nor arsenal to provide them with supplies, and they were not allowed to live "by plunder," as it was called by men who were ignorant of the first elements of the art of war.</p>
        <p>When the peasantry departed for their homes, and the leaders were deserted, McManus took to the hills, in company with Meagher, after having dismissed the men who came with him from England in a vessel chartered by himself, in order to escape the vigilance of the detectives. After having wandered in the mountains of Tipperary, Waterford and Cork for a few weeks, McManus escaped in a vessel bound for New York from Queenstown. But before setting sail, the captain, who was an Englishman, betrayed and delivered him to the authorities. The crew of the vessel, including the mate, who were Irish, offered him arms and were ready to fight for him; but as there were two gunboats in sight, and to avoid bloodshed, he refused their offers and surrendered without a struggle. He was taken to Dublin and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. But on account of public opinion, and because it was notorious that McManus and his fellow prisoners had an unfair trial, the sentence of death was commuted to transport- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 325" />ation for life in Western Australia. His treatment under the inhuman Governor Dennison was cruel in the extreme, and for disobeying police regulations in going out of his district to visit Smith O'Brien, he was sent to the galleys, and heavily chained and otherwise tortured. The Irish citiezns [sic] of Australia appealed to the law of the colony against the harsh rule of Dennison, and obtained his release again under a ticket of leave from the galleys.</p>
        <p>He was then--with a view, no doubt, of torturing him to death--ordered to walk all the way back, 150 miles from where he was confined on the galleys, to his former station. In attempting this feat he fell into a fever, which nearly cost him his life. He remained unconcious [sic] for over five weeks. After a sensible improvement in his health he was conveyed on board an American whaler, the captain of which, for $600, agreed to take him to California. His reception by his countrymen and the citizens generally here was an ovation of no ordinary character. He then settled down to reside here, where he spent nine years, till he died in 1861, January 15. His remains were sent to Ireland, and rest in peace in Glasnevin Cemetery. The McManuses were an old clan connected with the McGuires, and got 
        <pb n="326 The Irish Race in California." />their name from one of their ancestors who was born with a red band.</p>
        <p>COLONEL THOMAS HAYES landed in San Francisco July 1st, 1840. He was a native of Roscarburg, County Cork, Ireland, but came to America with his parents when quite young. His father, Timothy Hayes, was a plain, honest farmer, and his mother, a Mahony by her maiden name, was a woman of marked character, as she was of good sense and genuine piety. Thomas was the oldest but one of five or six children, and got his education in New York City. He was from his boyhood distinguished for his candor and spirit, and no sooner was he able to read the history of his native land, than a fire of patriotism was kindled within him, which was only extinguished at his death. Hence, when revolutionary movements were set on foot for the liberation of Ireland, and money was freely subscribed even by such men as Bishop Hughes, who gave $500, Thomas Hayes was entrusted with some important commissions favoring the patriotic work. He and another, if we mistake not, Michael O'Connor (editor of the Irish Volunteer), were sent by the New York directory to Canada to enlist the Irish-Canadians in the cause, and had made some progress, when the "fiasco" of "Slieb-na-man" took place. Dis- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 327" />couraged by the failure of the movement in which all his energies were centered, he left New York, and took shipping for San Francisco, via Cape Horn, with a quantity of goods for this market. The rest of his history is well known. It has been said by those who knew him intimately, that he was one of the whitest men who ever landed on this coast. He was hospitable, brave, generous, a good son, a true friend, and an incorruptible citizen and public officer. One instance is given of his courage, when the vigilants called on all the public officers to resign. He being then, we believe, County Clerk, he answered the armed deputation, "This is my office; you go back to those who sent you. I have no answer to send to the demands of an illegal body." This was an answer worthy of "Old Hickory." He died on board the steamer in which he sailed to New York in 1862, and his remains rest in Lone Mountain Cemetery. He was the owner of valuable property at his death, and had liberal bequests made to his sisters, brothers and relatives, which owing to some mismanagement of his executors were never carried out.</p>
        <p>Following are notices of the press of San Francisco, and the honorable public testimony borne to Colonel Hayes' virtues, by the unanimous vote 
        <pb n="328 The Irish Race in California." />of the Mayor and City Council of San Francisco:THOMAS HAYES.--The hand of death has struck down a true and noble-souled Irishman in the person of Colonel Thomas Hayes, who died this week on his voyage to New York, whither he had proceeded as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. A dauntless spirit, an exalted sense of honor, and a princely liberality of disposition, combined with a kindly heart, had long ago ensured Thomas Hayes the respect of the California public, and the warm and sincere attachment of a band of devoted friends, who feel that it will be long before they shall meet his like again. Colonel Hayes was a native of Ross, in the County Cork, Ireland, from which his parents emigrated to New York some forty-two years ago, while their son Thomas was only an infant of three or four summers. His boyhood was spent in Schaghticoke, N. Y., where his father still resides. When grown to manhood, he removed to New York City, where he obtained a position in the Weigher's Department of the Custom House, and where he subsequently was elected Assessor of the 4th Ward. During the candidacy of Mr. Cass for the Presidency, Mr. Hayes supported his party, and was chosen a delegate to the State Convention in his 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 329" />interest. Nevertheless, though thus engaged in the politics of his adopted country, he did not forget the claims of his native land on his allegiance. When the burning eloquence and youthful ardor of the Young Ireland party threatened to precipitate a contest between the then famine-stricken Irish people and their English rulers, Thomas Hayes devoted himself heart and soul to the sacred cause of Ireland.</p>
        <p>Copy of a Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco in reference to the late Colonel Thomas Hayes:Whereas, The remains of the late Colonel Thos. Hayes are to be interred in this city on the 27th day of March, inst.; andWhereas, Colonel Hayes was one of the earliest and most active and useful of the pioneer residents of San Francisco, having arrived here in July, '49, and having at once made San Francisco his home, and having continued until his death, encouraged and helped to build up all its material, moral and educational interests, and having always displayed an almost exceptional hospitality and charity; andWhereas, He was, from the earliest times, employed in many offices in this city of honor and responsibility, commencing with a deputy sheriff- 
        <pb n="330 The Irish Race in California." />ship, under Colonel Jack Hayes, having been County Clerk for two terms and president of the Charter Convention of this city, which paved the way for the Van Ness Ordinance and the Consolidated Bill, and other public benefits; andWhereas, In all his official acts he sustained the character of an upright, honest and honorable officer; andWhereas, He was also a member of the Assistant Board of Aldermen in the year 1852, which was one of the progenitors of our present Board of Supervisors; now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, it is herebyResolved, By the Board of Supervisors of the City and County, that a vote of sympathy, respect and condolence be passed by this body upon the death of the late Colonel Thomas Hayes, and that a copy of this resolution be presented, by the clerk, to his afflicted family, and that this Board attend his funeral in a body and wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days.</p>

        <p>OUR STATESMEN CONTINUED. SENATORS CONNESS AND CAS-SERLY. STATE SENATORS ROACH, McKOPPIN [sic] AND KEN-NEDY.</p>
        <p>Hon. John Conness, United States Senator for the term commencing in 1863, is a native of Portumna, County of Galway. Coming to the United States at an early day, like most of his countrymen, to better his condition as well as to escape the annoyances of the British Government in Ireland, Mr. Conness having received a good education in his native land, found no obstacle on his road to advancement in this free country. Hence we find his name among the law-makers in the California Legislature as early as 1860. He got the nomination for Governor in 1862, from both the Republican and Independent Democratic parties, but was defeated by Leland Stanford. He was then a resident of Eldorado County. He was at one time suspected of favoring disunion and the "lost cause," but by a letter of his written at Georgetown, dated Oct. 3, 1861, Mr. Conness proved himself a lover of his adopted country, and a true patriot.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="332 The Irish Race in California." />"I cannot understand how any man who pays attention to public affairs, can fail to understand my position as to parties, or that of fealty to the Government. Those statements are made by uninformed or idle persons for sensation purposes, or for the meaner purpose of injuring me.</p>
        <p>"If every man in California were against the Union, and against using all the power of the Government to preserve itself, I would be FOR both, against the people, and I would seek some other place of abode. My opinions do not grow out of the influences of my neighbors, but are the results of my love of country and my estimate of its value. I have not associated, nor shall I knowingly associate with men who are secessionists, disunionists or traitors; nor will I advise others to do so. Treason is as foul a crime as it was in the time of Benedict Arnold, and West Point was not worth any more then, than Manassas, is now. Any opposition to our present nationality, is treasonable, pending war, and ought to be punished by banishment from the State, or incarceration in prison. Upon the terms of Union, I can have political association, and upon no other. I care not whether my associates come from one party or another, as long as they are true upon the one vital point.</p>
        <p>"To the Democratic party as Buchanan made it, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 333" />I am opposed. To the same party as Douglass would have redeemed it, I am firmly attached; but my attachment to it goes no farther than the extent it can be made useful to the cause of universal civil liberty. With me, the UNION is above all parties. It is a crime now to raise party above country, or to consider personal interests pending the greatest danger to all we have as a people worth preserving. That there are many partizans [sic] base enough to do so, we know. Attempts to make political parties by specific arguments and division of spoils will always fail, and are always made by narrow (minded?) and bad men. To conclude, however others may act, I have but one desire, which is, that this government may be more firmly established in the fear and love of our people, that its prosperity may be continued, and that it may be securely transmitted to our posterity to the remotest ages.</p>
        <p>JOHN CONNESS."These sentiments, expressed in plain and unstudied phrase, were certainly very patriotic, and deservedly raised Mr. Conness in the estimation of his fellow-citizens. He, like all of his countrymen at that day, was ready to make any sacrifices for the preservation of the government, and as "good men and true" were then appreciated, and many 
        <pb n="334 The Irish Race in California." />of the sons of the soil were ready to plunge the sword of schism and separation into the bosom of the Republic, the common mother of all the people, Conness, though Irish, was soon chosen and sent to Washington to give expression and effect, as a United States Senator, to the patriotic sentiments that glowed within his breast. No matter under what party banner he fought and conquered, he was the same as Broderick, Casserly, Downey and all the statesmen of our race in his unselfish defence of the Union.</p>
        <p>The Connesses, "ua Coinnise," were of very ancient date in Connaught, bordering on the County of Clare, where several families of the name are found to the present day.</p>
        <p>SENATOR EUGENE CASSERLY is one of those Irishmen who is not ashamed of his native land, and though he was so young when he crossed the Atlantic Ocean--not over two years--that he could, without danger of being detected, pass himself off as a native of "Irish or Scotch-Irish origin," yet, to his credit it must be said, that he never denied the country of his nativity. Unlike Senator Broderick, our honorable statesman had every opportunity of a first-class education. It may be said that from the cradle he began the arduous ascent to Parnassus, "gradus ad Parnassum." In a 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 335" />word, before he gained his majority he was an accomplished classical scholar, as well as thoroughly grounded in the principles of the most advanced scientific course of studies. Mr. Casserly's attainments in science were in advance of his contemporaries, and he found the sphere of his father's academy too narrow and confined for the display of his acquirements. The school-room was too limited for the exercise of his abilities, and hence, before he attained the legal age, we find him the editor of an influential journal in New York City. While presiding, in the editorial chair he commenced the study of law, and in his twenty-second year was admitted to the bar of New York.</p>
        <p>Coming to California in 1850, our Senator resumed the profession of a journalist with marked success and ability, until after about a year's conducting of his paper his office and all his effects were consumed by the disastrous fire of 1851. Mr. Casserly gave up journalism as a profession from this date, and, resuming the law, he rose very rapidly into distinction.</p>
        <p>Though of a mild and pacific disposition, Senator Casserly, in speaking, kindles up into the glow of true Irish eloquence, which, flowing from his graceful lips enriched by copious figures and flowers of rhetoric, naturally springing from his deep 
        <pb n="336 The Irish Race in California." />classical studies, renders his oratory elegant and convincing at once, and seemingly without effort. Mr. Casserly, like the majority of his educated countrymen, is a Democrat in politics; and as attached to the party of his choice as he is to other and more important principles of his early years. In 1867 he was elected United States Senator, and his eloquence, moderation, and knowledge of parliamentary rules and amenities gained for him the general respect of that select body of statesmen, and elevated him to be the peer, if not the superior, of most of those who sat with him in that great assembly of law-makers.</p>
        <p>Senator Casserly stands high, not only as a statesman, but even in his private life it may be said of him that he is a model father, and husband of a spotless reputation. Men of his reputation are an honor to the land of their birth and adoption, and though of moderate views and of retiring inclinations, are those who are called to the helm when dangers threaten the ship of State. Though at present leading a dignified private life, without care or ambition, rumor has it that he will be called on again to fill the office of United States Senator, and if he shall be, the people and the State will be well represented.</p>
        <p>The Casserlys were an old and respectable fam- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 337" />ily, traced back to before the tenth century. The Irish orthography was Casserlaig, and there is on record where in an army in a province of Connaught, under the leadership of the Cathal Cruvderg O'Conners, the Melaghlins, the O'Kelleys, thc McEagans, the McDermotts, and other chiefs with Cumuman Casserly, were defeated by the English in 1249, in the neighborhood of Atheury, then held by the English garrison. It was on the 15th of August, and the English demanded a respite, not willing to fight on "Lady day," but the Irish troops, eager for the fray, led on by Cruvderg, who though willing to abstain from battle, could not be restrained by the sanctity of the day, and when the English turned out to meet their assailants, a panic took place, in which great crowds of the Irish were slain; among others the aforesaid Chief Casserly. This victory the English attributed to the "miracles of the blessed Virgin"--so at least is stated by the Irish annalists, under date of 1249.</p>
        <p>SENATOR PHILIP A. ROACH.--We gladly make room in our pages for the following notice of the Hon. Philip A. Roach, extracted from a memoir of him in an Eastern journal. Senator Roach is one of our most worthy representative men, and deserving of a first place among Irish-American 
        <pb n="338 The Irish Race in California." />statesmen. His integrity and ability as a public man are well known, while his honor and demeanor as a gentleman are worthy of the approbation of his fellow-citizens of every class. Senator Roach, though not claiming a descent in a direct line from "Heber or Heremon," is undoubtedly of Celtic origin, as were many of those of Norman extraction, brought to the shores of Erin by love of adventure or war.</p>
        <p>His forefathers were distinguished in the annals of Erin in the twelfth and following centuries. The part of the country which they claimed as their own by right of conquest or purchase was called "Roche's Country," comprising the present Barony of Fermoy, in the northern part of Cork. The Lordship of Fermoy is to this day held by the Roches, while persons of the name are to be found in many parts of the south of Ireland, as well as in the County of Cork.</p>
        <p>Philip A. Roach was born in Ireland, Nov. 1st, 1820. His family emigrated and settled in New York in 1822. His early education was received from private tutors and at private schools. At the age of fourteen years, be entered a large importing house as clerk, and followed commercial pursuits until 1844. Mr. Roach at an early age took an active part in the dis- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 339" />cussion of social and political questions, and frequently communications from his pen on themes of public interest were given through the columns of the New York papers. From New York he went to reside to Vicksburg, Miss., where he became editor of the Sentinel of that city. Retiring from this position after a short time, he next went to New Orleans, from which he departed, taking passage for Havre de Grace, in France, in 1844. In Havre he met with a cordial reception from friends; but having little business to occupy his attention, he went to Paris, where he attended the lectures at the College of France, on "General Literature," and at the University of Paris, on "Commercial and International Law "--his knowledge of the French language enabling him to profit by such profound and elegant dissertations. He subsequently visited London, Dublin, and other important localities in Ireland and England, and having ended his European tour, returned to the United States in 1846. After a short visit to Mississippi, he returned to New York, where he soon afterward received the appointment of United States Consul to Lisbon, from President Polk. In Lisbon he entered upon the discharge of the functions of his office, for which he was thoroughly com- 
        <pb n="340 The Irish Race in California." />petent on account of his familiarity with most of the modern European languages.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1847 Lisbon was visited by a severe earthquake which caused the ground to open in immense breaches in many places. The royal family fled from the city in terror, though the solidly constructed buildings, five and six stories high remained uninjured. Mr. Roach, from the sensations experienced by him at the time, enunciated subsequently the theory that earthquakes were caused by electrical action. He resigned his consulship in 1849, and having returned home to New York, left for California on the 30th of June, reaching the Isthmus on July the 7th, of that year. The weather on the Isthmus was intensely hot, the rain poured down in torrents, and cholera and fevers worked terrible havoc. Lieut. F. Beale, son of the United States Minister to Austria, H. Gray Otis and Mr. Roach were frequently called upon to wait on the sick and dying. Men fell dead so suddenly that hundreds became panic-stricken. Those who had signed their names as witnesses to attest the death of a friend, in a few hours were themselves corpses, in many instances. The gentlemen referred to rendered much assistance to the families of the deceased by attesting papers required in such cases, which ser- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 341" />vices the consul, Willliam [sic] Neilson, acknowledged by thanking Mr. Roach cordially for his kind aid in the premises. The steamer named the Panama made her appearance towards the end of July at Panama, and was immediately crowded with passengers eager to reach the "El Dorado," California, and willing to pay any sum to secure a passage. Some actually paid as high as $500 for deck and steerage accommodation on the steamer. The vessel arrived on the 15th of July at Monterey, then the capitol of California, as well as the naval and military headquarters of the government, and on the 18th she discharged her living freight at the port of San Francisco. After staying a couple of weeks in San Francisco, the scenes of gambling and dissipation visible on all sides so disgusted Mr. Roach, that he went back to Monterey and engaged in commercial pursuits, for the purposes of which he had sent, before he left New York, two large frame houses prepared for immediate erection, and to be used as stores, with an assortment of goods which arrived in two vessels, each afterwards being wrecked.</p>
        <p>The two frame houses were put up in Monterey in 1850, and remain to this day occupied and serviceable after twenty-seven years' existence. At the convention which met to frame the constitu- 
        <pb n="342 The Irish Race in California." />tion of the State, in obedience to a proclamation of General Riley, Mr. Roche rendered an important service by bringing together the Americans and native Californians and reconciling their differences, and explaining to the latter our theory of government--a thing he felt no difficulty in doing through his fluency of speaking the Spanish language.</p>
        <p>At a public meeting of the citizens of both nationalities he addressed the mixed body of people in both English and Spanish, explaining the new constitution, and so satisfactory were his remarks to both parties that he was unanimously solicited to select any office he desired under the new order of affairs, but he declined to become a candidate for office. Leaving Monterey for San Francisco, on business, in the early part of November, he learned, with surprise, when he reached Monterey that he had been elected in his absence to two offices. At the earnest persuasion of the law-abiding citizens he accepted the one of honorary character, namely, Alcalde and Judge of the First Instance.</p>
        <p>At this date the district of Monterey was infested by gangs of gamblers and desperadoes, who visited their outrages principally on the native population, and who, in some instances, fired on 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 343" />the civil officers and upon the military guards called out to aid them. Mr. Roach succeeded in arresting several of those outlaws and in bringing them to justice.</p>
        <p>Monterey was made a city under American law in April, 1850, and Mr. Roach became its first Mayor. General Riley's functions as civil and military Governor having ceased under the new constitution, the citizens determined to give him a farewell banquet, which accordingly came off on July the 30th, 1850. There were present on that occasion, besides the leading citizens, many officers who since have become distinguished as generals and major generals of the United States army.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach, on behalf of the citizens of Monterey, presented General Riley with a medal, bearing the arms of the city of Monterey engraved on it and weighing a pound of pure gold. He was also presented with a massive chain of specimens of gold and quartz. General Riley responded with great feeling in acknowledgment of his thanks for the valuable presents, and expressed his warm sympathies for the people among whom he had so long resided.</p>
        <p>During the Summer of the same year, Mr. Roach and Hon. J. B. Wall were appointed a committee to examine the Missions of Santa Cruz 
        <pb n="344 The Irish Race in California." />and Monterey Counties. The work was a very laborious one, as the drought had so dessicated [sic] everything that they had to carry, besides their rations, barley for their horses. In addition to these incumbrances [sic], they had to camp out every night, and that, too, in a country infested with bears and other savage wild beasts. An interesting account of this exploration, under guidance of Mr. Roach, was written but never published, the manuscript having been lost in the disastrous fire at San Francisco in 1851. Fifteen years afterward Mr. Roach visited one of the most interesting of these missions--that of San Antonio--where the same clergyman who was then is now officiating. That reverend gentleman had published a partial account of the labors and adventures of the Mission Visiting Committee in the San Francisco Monitor, but even that was destroyed by the mobs of 1855.</p>
        <p>In the year 1850 a report was brought to Monterey that a large steamer was wrecked on the coast. An expedition was fitted out by Mr. Mayor Roach--a large whaleboat obtained from Governor Riley, with a crew and plenty of provisions. Francis J. McGuire (brother of the late John Francis McGuire, M. P.), who was for over twelve years County Judge of Santa Barbara, took charge of 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 345" />the craft, and horsemen were sent overland to the scene of the disaster. They reached the wreck in time to give the needed assistance, and found that the "Sarah Sands," an old Atlantic steamer, was the vessel in question.</p>
        <p>Among the passengers were Myles D. Sweeny, now president of the Hibernia Bank, Charles, McC. Delany, and other prominent citizens.</p>
        <p>On September 3d, 1851, Mr. Roach was elected Senator from Monterey and Santa Cruz for two years, and in 1852 wrote a minority report against Chinese immigration. In that session he had a bill passed after great opposition, allowing married women to do business as "sole traders," and this is now the law of the land.</p>
        <p>In January 1853, Mr. Roach was appointed, by President Pierce, U. S. Appraiser for the District of San Francisco, which office he resigned in 1861.</p>
        <p>In 1854 he was elected Commissioner of Education for Monterey County, and trustee of the Catholic Orphan Asylum, of which he was also president for two years. He was elected director of the Society of Pioneers in 1857-8, vice-president of the same society in '59 and '60, and president of California Pioneers in 1860-1.</p>
        <p>From 1860 to '61 he was engaged in commercial 
        <pb n="346 The Irish Race in California." />pursuits, but from his taste and education, being inclined to literary pursuits and studies, in 1867 he purchased an interest in the San Francisco daily and weekly Examiner, since which time he has been one of the proprietors and editors.</p>
        <p>In 1857 Mr. Roach went to Washington on special Government business and returned home by way of Cuba. In the same year he was elected an honorary member of the Mechanic's Institute on account of his ably-written paper on "State Prison Labor."In 1873 he was elected to the State Senate of California for four years, running far ahead of his ticket.</p>
        <p>In May, 1876, he was one of the Commissioners of San Francisco, to go to Washington to secure Congressional action to restrict Chinese immigration. During this Eastern tour Senator Roach visited the principal cities of the East, where he found opinion strongly in favor of encouraging immigration, but by his arguments and explanations soon produced a marked change in public opinion on this question. At Washington he had a long audience with President Grant, the members of the Cabinet and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, regarding this troubled question. The efforts of the Commission succeeded in obtaining a 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 347" />Joint Congressional Committee to investigate the matter in California, which subsequently reported, showing the enormous evils of Mongolian immigration.</p>
        <p>In New York Senator Roach received a banquet at the Sturtevant House, from those California Pioneers then in the Empire city. Returning home by way of Virginia City, he there received an enthusiastic reception from the Pacific Coast Pioneers.</p>
        <p>Once more at home and attending to his editorial duties on the Examiner, he took a prominent part in the campaign for "Tilden and Reform," speaking in every ward of the city and throughout the southern tier of counties, where his addresses were very effective with the natives, whose language is as familiar to him as his mother tongue. He also addressed numerous bodies of foreign-born citizens in their various vernaculars, exercising everywhere, by his persuasive powers of oratory, a most powerful influence. In every campaign in California for twenty-seven years, Mr. Roach has been regarded as one of the champions of Democracy, and has fully bestowed his services, his time and his means, to sustain the standard of his political faith. Senator Roach is a man of character--a natural born leader of men, and would have made 
        <pb n="348 The Irish Race in California." />his mark in any community. Of fine personal appearance and gentlemanly instincts, he displays marked public spirit and a thoroughly upright and honest heart. His character is agreeably impressive, and he never fails to command respectful attention when he has anything to say. He is like Cato of old, a man of action as well as an elegant orator, and it is in action that his large and generous resources find fitting expression. He is true to his convictions, and from what he conceives to be right he cannot be moved a hair's breadth. Of him it may well be said in the future,We will add that such a man is an honor to the land that gave him birth, as well as to that of his adoption and choice; and, though so gifted and accomplished as an orator, a linguist and a statesman, such is the Senator's unassuming modesty that he absolutely refused to give the author any data from which he could write a brief account of his eventful life. The above imperfect sketch he copied from a copy of an Eastern journal lent to him by an obliging friend.</p>

        <p>SENATOR E. NUNAN. SENATORS McCOPPIN, MURPHYS, FAR-LEY, DONOVAN, FOWLER. HON. JAS. KENNEDY.</p>
        <p>THE HON. EDWARD NUNAN'S name must, of right, find a place among our imperfect list of Irish-American statesmen. Senator Nunan came of a family which from "time immemorial," in Ireland, were distinguished for literary qualifications. In fact, the Nunans--"Nuenauns," in Irish--were hereditary bards and literati in Thomond long before the light of the Gospel lit up the dark recesses of Druidical groves and caves on both shores of the Shannon, or the benediction of St. Patrick extinguished forever the fatal torch of "Carrig o'guinal."Then the Nunans, as poets and companions of chiefs and princes, could indulge in their tastes; and even after learning and poetry were made capital offences by Anglo-Saxon penal enactments, the Nunans did not bow their necks to the yoke of the oppressor or receive his proffered bribe, but unhesitatingly followed the priest and the chief into exile; and when exile abroad was impossible, on 
        <pb n="350 The Irish Race in California." />account of the vigilance of tyranny, they retired to the mountain glens and the deep recesses of the forests to keep the lamp of literature burning, or to commit to the keeping of immortal song the the [sic] traditional lore of their oppressed country.</p>
        <p>We find one of this name a hermit in the seventh century, and another was a saintly abbot of the famous "Innis Cathai," or the Holy Island, in the Lower Shannon, near Kilrush.</p>
        <p>The subject of this notice was born in Limerick, and his father was a man whose independent spirit was manifested by the determined opposition which he offered to the collection of the odious tithes by the ministers of the established Church in Ireland. In his time, every church minister was made a magistrate by the order of the Government, and it was customary for the preacher, when he went around to collect his charges, to be accompanied by a platoon or a regiment of soldiers, to seize and distrain for tithes, to intimidate the peasantry, and to shoot them if they made any resistance to the collection of the revenues for the support of a creed which the people detested, and which was associated in their minds with scenes of rapine and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>An instance will illustrate the working of the collection of tithes by the Protestant clergy 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 351" />from the Catholic peasantry. In or about 1834 one Parson Rider, in Rathcomic, County of Cork, accompanied by a posse of armed soldiers, went to collect his tithes. Coming to the house of a poor widow who owned no real or personal property, except a pig, or rather a hog, the Parson of "pure reformed religion" ordered the hog to be driven to auction to have the animal sold for his dues of five shillings, or $1.25. The widow's only son, a lad of fifteen years, attempted to rescue the pig, the only property of his poor mother, whereupon the Parson ordered the soldiers to fire, which they were obliged to do, for he was squire as well as preacher. They raised their muskets, and the poor widow's son fell dead, pierced by a dozen bullets. The Parson told the widow he "sarved her right," as she should have paid him her tithes.</p>
        <p>This system was carried on in Ireland for centuries, and there was no redress for wrongs committed in the name of the reformed religion, till within a few years ago, when the tyrants themselves got ashamed of their cruelties against a plundered people. But, though the Catholic people paid the tithes, that is, the tenth of their crops and revenues to support the Protestant religion, they always paid these unjust im- 
        <pb n="352 The Irish Race in California." />posts under protest, and had recourse to all legal remedies to evade the payment.</p>
        <p>Senator Nunan's father, being a guide and prudent adviser of his less prosperous neighbors, took a prominent part in his opposition to the tithes. This opposition, however, comes under the category of "passive resistance," but, in many instances, was more grievous to the parson, as it was more safe to the peasant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nunan consulted the best lawyers as to the most effectual manner of evading the payment of tithes, and held correspondence with the most eminent men of the nation, such as Dr. Doyle and O'Connell, on resisting the payment of this odious claim. The parsons of that day often found themselves foiled in their attempts to distrain the goods and chattels of many a poor peasant, and accordingly the agrarian asserter of religious liberty came in for no small share of their hatred. Mr. Nunan, therefore, well knowing that in those days it was a dangerous thing to incur the displeasure or enmity of the English Churchmen--for the parsons had the law on their side, as well as the power to pervert it--he, with his family, seeing dangers ahead, came to the conclusion to quit his native land, where his forefathers flourished since the days of King Dathi. He accord-&lt;illustration&gt;SENATOR E. NUNAN&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 353" />ingly sold out his land and homestead, and took shipping for the Australian colonies. Several other families, neighbors and relatives of the Nunans, quitted Erin, the land of their love and birth, at the same time, and though,yet they preferred to go around to the other side of the world rather than any longer put up with the galling persecution of English Protestantism, which, while it robbed them and tried to degrade them, as men, in this life, did not scruple blasphemously to consign their souls to damnation in the next,these considerations could not fail to make lasting impressions on the reflecting mind of the young Nunan, who has ever since devoted his talents and abilities to the cause of freedom to all mankind.</p>
        <p>Senator Nunan is a man, not only of ability, but of genius. He has a mechanical talent of no ordinary kind, and, though he never served his time to acquire a handicraft, yet he is, and is known to be, a master in the art of building. The designing and execution of the Andrews' elegant jewelry palace on Montgomery street, gives evidence of his skill. Thus, by being a mechanic by 
        <pb n="354 The Irish Race in California." />nature and a statesman by the suffrages of' his fellow-citizens, Edward Nunan realizes, in his education, what Plato recommended, namely, "that all public men should learn some handicraft or trade," to ensure the health and vigor of the body, as well as to relieve the mind from the weakness of over-exertion or too much application.</p>
        <p>Senator Nunan bears a striking resemblance, in his head and features and figure, to the late Stephen A. Douglas; who, by the way, followed and exercised the trade of a carpenter before he was a statesman. Of the Senator's contributions to local enactments, as a Supervisor, or of the bills introduced by him in the State Senate, though they were important, we cannot specify in this sketch, his modesty compelling him to refuse giving the writer a personal account of his services in that way. But, from what we could learn from conversations with him in his library and when disengaged from study, we have no hesitation in saying that he is not only a man of great practical ability, but a profound thinker and a statesman of comprehensive views and sound philosophy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nunan is a comparatively young man, and, having the "mens sana in corpore sano," is likely to live a long and useful life. We therefore predict for him a very successful and bright career in 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 355" />the future history of the State and of the country. His originality, his wit, his sincerity of purpose and honor as a public man authorize us to expect more than common from Senator Nunan.</p>
        <p>Senator Edward Nunan, no doubt attracted to our shores by his innate love of liberty, came to California, from Australia, in 1850, since which time he has been prominently before the public as Supervisor, as member of the Legislature, and other public offices.</p>
        <p>As a Supervisor he introduced very important measures in relation to the grading of streets and disposing of the outside lands, and passing Order 900, which saved the city hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. He has the mind to conceive and the will to execute the most useful legislative enactments, if not incumbered [sic] by the trammels of political cliques and rings.</p>
        <p>His connection with the Mercantile Library was also most creditable to himself and advantageous to that useful corporation. At a time when that institution was on its last legs and most likely to fail, owing to the narrow and exclusive views of some of its members, Nunan, as one who appreciated the utility of a valuable public library, put his shoulder to the wheel, and by aid of his numerous friends and well-considered plans, relieved it 
        <pb n="356 The Irish Race in California." />of embarassment [sic] and placed it financially and otherwise on a sound liberal basis.</p>
        <p>Senator Nunan is not sufficiently appreciated as a public man. He may not be perfect in setting in motion the lower wheels of the political machine, but wherever profound thought and deliberation are called into action, it is then that the resources of an original mind are called forth and manifested. Nunan's bill establishing a Board of Work for San Francisco, in the present session, has been pronounced perfect by high judicial authority, and if passed, all allow, will save the city millions. And his bill in reference to coolie labor is allowed to be the best one ever offered. Yet, such is the prejudice, or infatuation, not to say corruption, of interested parties, that those two grand measures for the public good, and displaying in their wording a profound knowledge of' municipal law, may possibly be rejected by the votes of members who could not give a definition of the word "municipality."SENATOR FRANK McCOPPIN was born in the city of Longford, Ireland, on the fourth of July, 1834, and is consequently under forty-four years of age. He received his preliminary education in his native town, then well provided with good schools and academies.</p>
        <p>When about eighteen years of age, he bid 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 357" />adieu to the land of his nativity, and came with his parents on a sailing vessel to the United States, then the "land of promise," to most intelligent and educated young Irishmen.</p>
        <p>After having spent about six years in the Eastern States, engaged in commercial business, he came to San Francisco, where he arrived in 1858. Soon after his arrival, he was engaged as superintendent of construction of the Market Street City Railroad in which a good deal of grading had to be done, and considerable engineering skill to be exercised on account of sand drifts and other obstructions.</p>
        <p>In 1860, just two years after he arrived in California, and only eight years after he left home in Erin, he was elected Supervisor for the city of San Francisco, and was re-elected to the same office for four terms successively. Finally, in 1867 he was elected Mayor of this great city just nine years after his arrival as an immigrant, and sixteen years after he landed on the continent ;and when he reached this highest pinacle [sic] of civic honors, he was only thirty-four years of age! We believe that this gradation in the scale of popular promotion is unprecedented in the records of the State or of the country. Here is a gentleman who left Ireland, not as a capitalist or distinguished profes- 
        <pb n="358 The Irish Race in California." />sional man, but as an emigrant, with no capital but his brains, and no letters of introduction but what was written in his candid, open countenance, and we find him chief magistrate of one of the most famous cities of the continent, just sixteen years after he bade adieu to the humble abode of his birth in Longford!</p>
        <p>We have read of promotions through wars, revolutions, and conquests, but we never read of such, through the ordinary course of civil life, as that of Senator McCoppin. There could be no pipe-laying or wire-pulling, as the politician slang designate it in this case.</p>
        <p>McCoppin could have but very few acquaintances, not to talk of numerous and powerful patrons, when the civic honors of San Francisco began to fall on his shoulders. How could a man without money or mines purchase friends or patrons after having spent but two years in the country? He could not bribe judges or control ballot-boxes or move secret organizations.</p>
        <p>There is but one way to account for his extraordinary elevation into official consequence, and that is, that he must be a man of first-class talents.</p>
        <p>In 1862, the Senator got married to Miss Van Ness, the accomplished daughter of the statesman of that name, the originator of the famous "Van 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 359" />Ness Ordinance," and that happy event has not in the least impeded his political advancement.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCoppin was Mayor when the city's title to what were called the "outside lands" was settled. These lands were valued then at many millions of dollars, and the settlement of the titles to them was the most important question which ever came before the municipal representative body for decision, which settlement was materially aided by the efforts of Hon. E. Nunan, then a member of the Board of Supervisors.</p>
        <p>Mayor McCoppin was then in the civic chair, and he had the genius to comprehend and to decide the grand question. The Golden Gate Park was secured forever for the citizens, as the fruit of the enlightened legislation of McCoppin and his coadjutors. During a period of ten years, from 1860 to 1870, the name and the official acts of Senator McCoppin are intimately interwoven and blended with the municipal history of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The inaugural address and messages and other public documents of Mayor McCoppin, as published in the Municipal Reports of the years from 1867 to 1870, are masterpieces of composition and of statesmanlike views upon municipal government. Such is the estimation in which McCoppin's pub- 
        <pb n="360 The Irish Race in California." />lished opinions are held that quotations have been made from them by Mayor Bryant and others in their messages and documentory [sic] publications.</p>
        <p>Senator McCoppin is a man of commanding appearance and dignified manners and magnificent figure. His very presence inspires respect, and among thousands he could not fail to be pointed out as a remarkable man.</p>
        <p>SENATORS BERNARD AND PATRICK MURPHY, of San Jose and San Luis Obispo, are brothers, and among the best educated and most influential members of the Senate. They represent the distinguished Murphy family of which we have already given brief memoirs in a previous chapter of this work. Those gentlemen, from their wealth and standing in society, most likely, have not sought the positions in the commonwealth to which their constituents have elected them on account of their well-known worth and integrity. Bernard has been Mayor of San Jose for four different terms, and frequently in the Legislature. He, with his brother, was also a member of the Constitutional Convention of the State. Indeed, there is no office in the gift of the people to which, if ambitious, they may not aspire with a certainty of success. They are both young men--under forty--and no doubt they will be the recipients of further honors from 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 361" />their fellow citizens. Such men as these, whom all men know to be above purchase, are those who ought to be elevated into the highest places in the State, and not political adventurers and hucksters who have their price, and are in the market to be bought and sold like the wares out of the traffic of which they advanced from poverty and degradation. Bernard Murphy is what used to be called in classic lore, "homo ad unquem factus," while Patrick, notwithstanding his polished education and his knowledge of Spanish equal to a Castilian, and nativity in California, retains as much of the Irish gentleman as if he saw the the [sic] light and was brought up in old Wexford, of the '98 heroes. The black curly hair of Senator Patrick, and his mustachios a la mode Imperiale, together with his pure, rich pronunciation of the Castilian, cause many of the Spaniards to think that he is a native-born Hidalgo of Spain. Hence, he is at home in San Luis Obispo, surrounded as he is by his broad domain of between 50,000 and 60,000 acres of the best land in California. It is a proud consideration for his friends and for Irishmen, that Senator Murphy is the principal man in his county, and that no one can compete with him for any honors in the gifts of the citizens. Patrick Dunn, a native of Galway, is also a very influential 
        <pb n="362 The Irish Race in California." />Irish farmer in or near San Luis Obispo, as is also Captain Mallogh, a native of the north of Ireland, who settled there in 1846.</p>
        <p>U. S. SENATOR FARLEY is a sprout from the old Irish stock, though with a weakness unaccountable, unless it be the offspring of "Knownothingism," the Senator elect would prefer to have people believe that he is of "Scotch origin." Not all the antiquarians in the world, however, from Adamnan to McFirbis, and from him to Curry, could ever point out the birth or descent of a Farley, Farrelly or O'Farrell, from a Scotch origin. "Farley" is only an abbreviation of Farrelly, who were chiefs of Tullahoge, and before the date of the Irish colonization of Scotland, whether under " Aengus" or "Carbre Riadagh," the Farleys were unknown. The Senator elect, however, by his fine appearance and Celtic physignomy [sic] and acute, cunning looks, gives a flat contradiction to his theory of Scottish origin, so that, nolens volens, we must claim him of Irish descent, if not birth. The only consideration that would seem to favor his Scotch descent, would be the truth of the accusation made against him--that he is the purchased tool of the railroad corporation; but this charge we regard as groundless, and among many other reasons, because he is of the Irish race, which is the highest honor he 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 363" />can aspire to. Senator Farley is an eloquent and able speaker, and before his late election filled many position of honor, such as Speaker of the Assembly and President of the State Senate. He is a gentleman of liberal views and of finished education, and a lawyer by profession, and no doubt will do honor to his place in the Senate of the United States, as his predecessors, Casserly, Conness and Broderick, did before him. The charges of venality and political corruption made against Senator Farley are refuted by the acts of his public life, and the fact that he is a poor man, which he need not have been if he were in the pay of the bloated, corrupt railroad monopoly of the Central Pacific.</p>
        <p>SENATOR DONOVAN, of the State Legislature, is a native of Cork, Ireland, from near Bandon. He was born in 1847, and crossed the Atlantic on his mother's breast, before he was a year old. The Senator is, therefore, a very young man, not fully thirty two, and, no doubt, owes his elevation to the important office of Senator to his well-known sound principles and excellent education. He received his primary instruction in private schools, in the State of Virginia, where many of the sound customs of the old country still continue, and graduated or finished his education in Georgetown 
        <pb n="364 The Irish Race in California." />College, near Washington. Mr. Donovan was elected as a member of the Board of Education in 1870, and while in that position gave expression to some sound doctrines which proved unpalatable to some people of illiberal and intolerant views.</p>
        <p>Senator Donovan is a gentleman of grave and dignified, though of youthful, appearance, and his remarks and speeches, which are always in good taste and moderate, command the respectful attention of his colleagues. Like all the statesmen of the old Grecian republics, Mr. Donovan exercises a handicraft, being a painter by trade. We predict for him a bright future, for when he is such in his youth we may ask what will he be in his ripe manhood? He is Senator from the Twelfth District, and this is his second session in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>SENATOR THOMAS FOWLER is a native of the County of Down, Ireland, and came to America in 1847. He came to California across the plains, driving an ox team, in 1852. He is now owner of herds of kine and sheep which count by the thousand, and which range over 40,000 acres of pasture. His constituents are scattered over five counties, containing more land than all Ireland, and yet this plain, blunt, and honest man has been 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 365" />elected by a large majority of a population containing but few of his countrymen. "Honest" Tom Fowler, as he is familiarly called, is a large, well built, brawny man, of sound body as well as active mind. He is one of those men who cannot be purchased by all the treasure of wealthy corporations or by individual largesses. Senator Fowler was one of those who labored hard to defeat the Railroad Subsidy bill, but his individual efforts, though valuable, could do but little against a bloated corporation which has a reservation fund of many millions, and controls the votes of statesmen, so called, as if they were so many pawns on the surface of a chess-board. The Senator has a very interesting young family of five children, and is still a young man under fifty. He is deservedly to be ranked among the statesmen of our race whom he faithfully represents in Tulare County, where his farm is not far from being as extensive as his native county of Down, which, from its alternate hills and valleys, has been compared to a "basket of eggs" by Walter Scott. And, he owns twenty thousand head of cattle which graze over his princely domain.</p>
        <p>HON. JOHN KENNEDY, a member of the State Legislature, deserves to have his name recorded as a representative of the Irish race; as far as descent 
        <pb n="366 The Irish Race in California." />is concerned he certainly comes of the best blood in Ireland. The Kennedys have, for a thousand years at least, been identified with the history of Ireland, from the era of the illustrious Brian McKennedy, surnamed Boru, to the present day. People not conversant with Irish history fancy Brian was the family name of the conqueror of the Danes, at Clontarf, in 1014. No; Brian was his Christian name, Kennedy, or "Cinneadie," being the family name. The Monarch Brian deposed Maelshauglin from being Ardrigh in 1002, and was himself twelve years High King when killed at Clontarf by Broder the Dane.</p>
        <p>In that battle twelve Irish kings and princes fell, and a grandson of Brian, a youth of fifteen years, was found drowned in the sea, into which he had dragged a Danish chief, and held his head under till he was suffocated.</p>
        <p>The Danes were utterly routed, though the victory cost Erin the best blood of her sons. This is the pedigree to which the subject of this sketch, without doubt, belongs.</p>
        <p>He was born in Stonehall, in Limerick, and the maternal branch of the family was O'Brien. Our legislator has two brothers in this city also, Patrick and Bryan, in competent circumstances, and not at all unworthy of their ancient honorable descent.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 367" />While in the Legislature Hon. John Kennedy introduced a very important measure, called the "Tax Collector's Bill," which became a law, having been supported by all parties in the House as a very useful measure.</p>
        <p>Another very important bill introduced by Mr. Kennedy, in relation to the reduction of salaries for executive officers, failed because the San Francisco delegation were unwilling to support it. This was a measure loudly called for, both on account of the economy which civil reform demands, as well as because of the general depression in business and reduction in value of real-estate. The municipal officers of San Francisco are better paid than those of any other city on the continent, or in the world, the total expences [sic] for the past year being, according to public reports, one million two hundred thousand dollars! A large sum truly, and one that ought to afford, without distressing individuals, a reduction of at least one third in the aggregate. High salaries are a great temptation to unprincipled men to use improper means to get into office; hence, we find frauds at elections, bribery, direct or indirect, and disregard of the sanctity of oaths. It is to the same desire of getting wealth, too, that while the poor man is unjustly or unmercifully punished, a rich man is sure if accused of crime, to 
        <pb n="368 The Irish Race in California." />escape with impunity. High salaries, therefore, lead to the perversion of law and justice, because men of no principles are induced to seek for offices.</p>
        <p>If no salaries were paid magistrates, as is generally the case in Great Britain, or very trifling salaries, as on the continent, there would be more impartiality in the administration of justice, and bad men would not be tempted to aspire to judicial positions of which they are unworthy. These abuses Mr. Kennedy's bill attempted to correct, but it failed because of lack of support from those who, perhaps, looked forward to the time when they would be candidates for the offices, the fees of which the bill contemplated the reduction of.</p>
        <p>HON. DAVID MAHONY, who was State Senator for a term or two, is a native of Mitchelstown, County Cork. He and his brother Denis came to this State before '49, and the former gave great satisfaction while in office. They deserve an honorable place of record among the Pioneers of our race on this coast.</p>
        <p>We are obliged to conclude our list of Irish-American statesmen in this chapter. The list is imperfect and could be increased three-fold, but, owing to pressure of time and the neglect of some, such as Senator McG., to reply to our polite letters, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 369" />we had to finish these interesting memoirs of our countrymen.</p>
        <p>The Senate Chamber of the State contains about forty members, more than one-half of whom are of our race. The Assembly, out of eighty members, has about twenty-five of the same nationality, the majority of whom we omit in these pages. The entire Legislature of California, as a whole, compares favorably with any legislative assembly in the Union. The members are elegantly dressed, of very courteous and mild manners, with the absence of anything low either in their words or manners. There is not one among them who may not be entitled a gentleman, without mental reservation, though of course, many of them are not classically educated. There are many among them so wealthy as to be beyond the reach of bribery or corruption, and others whose character and honor put any such thing out of the question. There may be lobbyists and paid agents who hang around the portals of the State House, as birds of prey do around a slaughter-house, to devour the offals. But there are men, such as the Murphys, the Nunans, Fowlers, and others of our race, whom they dare not approach with a view of corruption.</p>
        <p>The Capitol building is a magnificent structure, one of the best, if not the very best, and most 
        <pb n="370 The Irish Race in California." />costly in the country. Arid this has an influence no doubt in elevating the sentiments of the law-makers. What a pity that those Latin mottoes over the chairs of the Senate and Assembly halls were not more elegantly and correctly engraved, Legislatorum est Justas Leges condere is very unclassical, not to say incorrect. It should be, "Legislatorum est Leges condere Justas," while the inscription in the Senate Chamber is still more faulty and incorrect, and not at all in keeping with the dignity of the place.</p>

        <p>OUR GREAT CAPITALISTS OF THE IRISH RACE. THE DONA-HUES. THE "BONANZA KINGS." MACKEY. FAIR.</p>
        <p>Who are the most successful men of this State, as capitalists, miners and bankers? Nay; who were and are the most enterprising men of the continent of North America? Are they native Americans of the Anglo-Saxon race, or men of the Latin, Celtic or Teutonic races? History and experience demonstrates that men of the last-named races are ahead of all others. The four greatest 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 371" />millionaires that the Eastern States knew were of foreign birth or origin. Stewart, Astor, Girard and Vanderbilt were of the Celtic, Latin or Gallic and Teutonic races.</p>
        <p>It is the same in this far West--our four or five greatest capitalists are of the Irish race, and the most successful of them are of Irish birth. Messrs. Flood and O'Brien are noticed in their published biographies, which we take to be authentic, as of American birth, which we doubt. But, granting that they were born under the Stars and Stripes, what do they gain thereby? Nothing but the flattery of the unreflecting and silly, while it is acknowledged that the two men of the firm who are of Irish birth, and pride in it, are far the ablest of its members. James Mackey, the youngest, is the most wealthy of the "Bonanza men," and Fair, another full-blooded Milesian, is next to Mackey in penetration, judgment and sagacity.</p>
        <p>They might gain the praise of unthinking men if they were vain enough to say they were born in Connecticut or New Jersey, or in some up-town street in Gotham. But they gain the admiration, if not the approbation, of all educated men by "not going back" on old Motherland. We know nothing of the principles or morality of those men (but 
        <pb n="372 The Irish Race in California." />we think they must be of the first order); what we introduce their names in our book for is to demonstrate the energy, ability and superiority of the Irish race on this coast. And the firm of the "Bonanza men," and their success and perseverance, and prudence and ability, afford a proof as clear as daylight, at least to those whom no theoretical arguments could convince or logical conclusions demonstrate, that the Irish race on this coast is what it has ever been in all countries where it had fair play, the bravest, the best, and the most enterprising. The reporters of a class of silly newspapers which are too plenty in this city, may turn the public sneer on Paddy or Bridget. But when one or two of the despised race are worth from five to fifty millions of dollars, that alters the case, and is very embarrassing to the crowd of Miso-Milesians who have no other argument to console their disappointment than to suppose such men must be born in this country or they could not be so successful. Hence they claim all great and rich men of "our race," and in their memoirs of them give them a borrowed nationality, or else they ignore them altogether as unworthy of a place in their inelegant annals or histories. It is to remedy this evil and gross injustice that we have undertaken to write and publish this volume, and 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 373" />if we have not succeeded in making it perfect or worthy of the theme we undertook to elucidate, we have at least made a beginning by the publication of a book which cannot fail to be interesting to the Irish race in California, and even in the United States.</p>
        <p>COLONEL PETER DONAHUE was born in Glasgow, in 1822, of Irish parents, his father, Peter, having gone to Scotland, most likely to avoid the persecutions of the dominant party in the north of Ireland. After the suppression of the rebellion of '98. Irishmen then, especially in Ulster, had little protection from the local magistrates, and their lives and property were in danger daily from the rapacity of a brutal faction. Hence, in the space of five years, more than 30,000 Irish Catholics exchanged their unprotected homes in their native lands for the uncertain chances of earning a livelihood in a more peaceful and enterprising portion of the empire. The city of Glasgow received the greater portion of these voluntary exiles, and in a few decades the "Irish Race" in Scotland formed a very industrious and almost indispensable section of the inhabitants of Glasgow, and of all the large manufacturing towns of Western Scotland. Thus, in the Providence of God, did Ireland return back to Scotland, peacefully, as many of her children as 
        <pb n="374 The Irish Race in California." />the latter country transplanted into Ireland by way of conquest in the preceding century.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Scottish Presbyterian "plantation" into Ulster was the eradication from Ulstermen of the national traditions and of the creed of Irishmen. But this the "plantation," backed and fostered by all the power of English bigotry, and aided by millions of money and thousands of her veteran soldiers, signally failed. For to-day, in Ulster even, the old inhabitants are two to one, or at least more than one-half of the population which one hundred years ago was almost exclusively of Scota-Saxon composition. But what the "plantation" of Ulster failed to do in Ireland, the Irish northern "exodus" has accomplished in Scotland. A body of more than two hundred thousand Irishmen form no insignificant portion of the population of Scotland, and by their good conduct, Christian demeanor and industry, have succeeded in revolutionizing the sentiments of the native Scotch, so far as to cause them to respect the opinions of their fellow-citizens of Irish birth, and in numerous cases to conform to the religious and political sentiments of Irishmen. The Irish to-day are a powerful element in national affairs in Scotland, which neither the Government nor any of the great political parties can despise. The writer 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 375" />of this knows something of Scotland from a residence there of some years, and he can say with out exaggeration, that in no part of Christendom are there men better instructed in their duties as Christians and citizens, and more steadfast in the faith of their forefathers, than in Scotland. Scottish thrift and industry, as a ground-work to build upon by Irish genius, lead generally to successful results. Hence the early training of the Donahue brothers in Scotland was favorable to their subsequent splendid success in California.</p>
        <p>Colonel Peter Donahue came to America in the year 1835 with his father, who settled in Patterson, in the State of New Jersey, where he was apprenticed to the iron foundry and machinist business with an extensive firm in that city. In 1847 he went to Peru, probably to superintend some iron manufacturing business for the Government of that Republic. He was the engineer of the first steamboat ever owned by the Government of Peru. He returned to New York after two years absence, and came to California in 49 on board the steamer Oregon, and immediately on his arrival joined his brother James as partner in a blacksmithing and machine shop on Montgomery street, and subsequently on First street, where the brothers established the first foundry 
        <pb n="376 The Irish Race in California." />and machine shop on the coast. In 1852 he started the gas works for illuminating the city, which enterprise is now on a firm basis of prosperity. In 1857-58 he ran an opposition line of steamers between San Francisco and Sacramento, and thus, indirectly, by breaking down a greedy monopoly of the California Steam Navigation Co., saved millions of dollars for the public. In 1860 he built the war steamer Saginaw for the Government, and soon after the Camanche, both of which gave satisfaction. In 1862 he held a two-thirds interest in the San Jose Railroad, which he afterwards sold to Stanford for a large sum. He was the first who introduced street railroads to the city, in 1861, and continues to direct these useful modes of travel up to the present. In 1870-71 he built the railroad from the village of "Donahue" to Healdsburg, a distance of eighty miles, and he is now prosecuting the completion of the narrow-gauge railroad from the Bay at San Quentin to the valley of Mendocino, and ultimately to Humboldt County.</p>
        <p>Peter Donahue now and for years past has been ranked among the millionaires of California. He acquired his wealth by hard, honest industry, and his property has grown by a gradual and natural, though a rapid accumulation. It was by no sudden advance in stocks or other ephemeral specula-&lt;illustration&gt;COL. PETER DONAHUE.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 377" />tions that the Donahues became independent, but by the exercise of the most prudent care and calculation, and the most strict integrity. Besides the ability and profound speculation which Peter Donahue and his brothers displayed in the wonderful success of their enterprises, in addition to the profit they brought their proprietors, also contributed to the improvement of the city and of the State. Men there are who have made more money perhaps than Peter Donahue in the same space of time, but, enveloped in the folds of an [n]arrow [sic] selfishness, like snails in their shells, their wealth has contributed little or nothing to the public improvements of the city.</p>
        <p>But the reverse has been the case with the Donahue improvements. The City Gas Works, the erection of large foundries, the building of steamboats and railroads, while they brought their owners a large and well-earned profit, brought also wealth, accommodation and improvements to the city and to extensive districts of the State. No ruined fortunes, no wild speculations or fraudulent contracts have contributed to the monument to Irish-American enterprise and prosperity which Peter Donahue has erected in this city and coast. It requires no genius to become rich through stock speculations or the discovery and development of 
        <pb n="378 The Irish Race in California." />rich mines; but to build up institutions such as gas works, foundries, lines of steamboats and railroads requires a genius of no common kind, and to carry these improvements to a successful issue under difficulties and opposition indicates abilities and statesmanship of the highest order. A fool may become wealthy by inheritance, or a laborer or a peasant may discover a "bonanza" by a stroke of a lucky pickax; but it takes a man of genius, of integrity and of honesty, as well as of sound sense, to carve out a princely fortune by the exercise of his faculties, and that in a community and in an age where the most vigorous competition had to be encountered.</p>
        <p>Peter Donahue and his brothers had to do all this and more before their success was placed on a secure foundation. Taking all the circumstances of this great man into consideration, it may be said that he is the most successful man of our race on this coast, if not on the continent. It is true Alex. Stewart, of New York, became wealthier, and other Irishmen of this coast are probably richer, than Peter Donahue, but as an example of persevering, honest enterprise he stands unrivaled.</p>
        <p>We have taken the substance of the above from printed sketches of the distinguished gentleman's career, and we insert the following extracts from 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 379" />the columns of the daily press in confirmation of what we have stated concerning Colonel Donahue:"The first printing press, the first cast-iron melting, and the first quartz mill of the State, for instance, were manufactured by Mr. Peter Donahue. The spirit of improvement and enterprise taking strong hold of the young ironfounder, he tore up the city's streets and laid gas-pipes down in '52, and five years after entered a very practical protest against monopolizing the traffic between this and our sleepy capital in the shape of an opposition line of steamers. Aptitude and reliability again attracted governmental attention, and the contract of building the Federal steamer Saginaw was in '60 awarded to the owner of these qualities, and a little later that of building the monitor Camanche. Traffic on the sea and traffic on the land quickly followed each other. In '61 the Omnibus Railroad Company was started, in '62 an interest was obtained in the San Jose line, and when that was transferred to Stanford, the Healdsburg line was established. Since that time this route has obtained the major part of his attention, and now, starting from a town which bears his name, it passes through a long, pleasant, fruitful valley, crosses the Russian River and climbs into the mountains beyond, and places the passenger 
        <pb n="380 The Irish Race in California." />among some of the grandest scenery in the State. Costly and bold in construction, the North Pacific Railroad is now a fortune; a well deserved fortune.</p>
        <p>Here the present record of a busy life stops. Stops to leave its subject yet in full manhood, with hosts of friends and the conciousness [sic] of having "worked while there is light"[sic] A splendid example of honest "push," he has ever a compassionate ear for those who have not so successfully striven; for whilst his one hand is a stranger to the good the other does, there is no man can say he has unavailingly presented a worthy case to Peter Donahue.--Post.</p>
        <p>"It was in September, 1870, that Colonel Peter Donahue embarked in the great enterprise of building a line of railroad from the old Embarcadero at Petaluma, through the rich county of Sonoma, to Russian River Valley. It was a favororable [sic] section for the undertaking, but it was a stupendous project for one man. It required brains and pluck as well as capital, but these essentials Colonel Donahue possessed then, and in an advanced measure he possesses them now. He looked into the feasibility and considered the possible results of the project, and resolved that he would take hold of it. He did so, and by the last day of that year he had completed the road to 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 381" />Santa Rosa. By April 17th of the succeeding year he pushed it through to Healdsburg, and thus brought within a few hours of San Francisco the most populous and important trade points of Sonoma County, famous as it is for its wealth of farming lands.</p>
        <p>In 1871 Colonel Donahue sold the road to the Central Pacific Company for the round sum of $750,000. By the new owners it was completed to Cloverdale. Afterwards Colonel Donahue bought it back at a cost of over a million of dollars, and built that portion which now extends from Donahue, upon the creek, to Petaluma, eight miles above. This gave the road a total length of fifty-six miles, directly through the best portions of Sonoma--a total length of rail and steamboat travel from San Francisco of ninety miles, and the full through trip either way is made in from four to five hours of delightful traveling.</p>
        <p>But Colonel Donahue did not stop at the construction of this line to Cloverdale in Russian River Valley. He next built a branch road from Fulton station west to Duncan's Mills, or Guernville, in the Redwoods, 22 miles, on which line can be seen some of the rarest scenery of the Coast. It is a route particularly worthy the attention of tourists, and there the noted redwood groves 
        <pb n="382 The Irish Race in California." />of California are to be seen in grandest proportions. The detour from the main road to visit old "Stumptown" will be enjoyed by all who make it.</p>
        <p>To connect with the trains at Donahue, thirty-four miles from San Francisco, are several fine, fast and commodious steamboats, which alternately ply--the James M. Donahue, the Antelope, the Milton S. Latham and another. Of these the one first mentioned is the finest and fleetest. Indeed she is the finest in California waters. She is named after the next youngest brother of Colonel Peter Donahue, who was of the old firm of the Donahue Brothers, from 1849 down to his death, in their Pioneer Foundry and Iron Works, machine shops, gas works, etc. The Donahue was built on San Francisco Bay in 1875, and her engine is a model of the perfection of machinery. Worthy is she of the name she bears.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad now runs no farther than Cloverdale. From there to more northern points in the upper tier of counties lines of stages regularly run. All the way north, clear to the Oregon line for that matter, there is a vast region of rich and fertile lands either already settled or susceptible of profitable occupation. With increased facilities for settlement or travel this great region will 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 383" />not be long in filling up. It requires only the means of ready transportation and expeditious travel to bring it actively into market and to invite thither population. Were the road to be pushed onward from Cloverdale to these more northern points it would materially advance the land valuation and hasten settlement. It will be singular if, with his noted great spirit of enterprise and his unquestioned ability to push on works of magnitude, Colonel Donahue does not extend the line of the road in the manner intimated. He has already done enough to distinguish himself and to win the meed of honest praise for his substantial benefits to the country; but he can still further add to his name and fame by simply keep up his accustomed pluck. There is no good reason to doubt that he will do otherwise than to constantly drive ahead wheresoever capital and ability point or beckon the way. It is his nature."--Examiner.</p>
        <p>Others of our race, perhaps over fifty in number, have become millionaires in San Francisco, but the enterprises by which they acquired their princely fortunes, were not so various, so difficult, or so useful as those of Peter Donahue. Finally, of Peter Donahue and his family it cannot be said that, like others of their race, they 
        <pb n="384 The Irish Race in California." />ever denied their ancestral principles or tried by change of spelling their names, to trace themselves to any other than the old pedigree of the pure, vigorous, and immortal Irish race, the most indestructible in the world.</p>
        <p>JAMES W. MACKEY is, they say, the most wealthy of the bonanza "kings." His income is $800,000 a month, which would be giving him $25 every minute in the twenty-four hours, which, with the regularity of clockwork, drops into his pockets, thus realizing more than ever was imagined by the writers of the "Arabian Tales," or their magical stories of suddenly acquired wealth!</p>
        <p>Mr. Mackey was born in Dublin in 1835, and is the youngest of the bonanza Plutocrats. He came to America when quite young, and was first employed, probably as a clerk, if not as a mechanic, in Wm. Henry Wells' ship building office in New York. He came to California in 1852, and at once become engaged in mining, first in Alleghany, Sierra County, California. He next moved on to Virginia City, in Nevada, where he took up a claim "on union ground," as it was called, and which was situated North of Ophir. In working this claim he lost his small capital, and then had to turn to and work at $4 a day in the frame work of the Mexican mine. He was reduced in circum- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 385" />stances but he never desponded, but he worked steadily and was often heard to declare, that his whole ambition was to earn $25,000 to enable him to make his poor mother comfortable, and she must have deserved his filial care, for she certainly grounded him in sound principles.</p>
        <p>In 1863 he entered into a partnership with one J. M. Walker, in mining business, in which success began to dawn on him. In 1868 Flood &amp; O'Brien joined the company, and soon after Mr. Fair came in on Walker's retiring from the partnership. The first money they made was in the "Hale &amp; Norcross" mine in 1865-7. They soon, through Mackey's sagacity and tact, got possession of the "Comstock claims," which cost them about $65,000, valued now at more than twice as many millions. And from that date, the four great miners have got the soubriquet of the "Bonanza Kings." Mr. Mackey got married in 1867 to a daughter of Col. Hungerford, and she well represents her husband on the continent, where she gives right royal receptions, so as to eclipse all the splendors of the great capital of modern luxury and fashion. James W. Mackey is a man of well known liberality, and no trifling share of his immense wealth flows into the asylums of the orphans and of the destitute.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="386 The Irish Race in California." />JAMES B. FAIR, ESQ., was born in Clogher, Tyrone, Ireland, in the year 1831. He came to New York, with his parents in 1843, and, of course, being but fourteen years of age, got his education in the United States. From New York he emigrated, and came to Illinois, where he finished his schooling at the Academy of Geneva, a village about thirty-six miles northwest of Chicago. In the latter place he engaged in a commercial concern for some time. But when the California fever broke out he joined a party of emigrants, and reached California, via Oregon, in August, 1849.</p>
        <p>Immediately after his arrival he commenced mining on the Feather River, Yuba County, at which place, however, he remained but about a year, when he removed to Virginia City, Nevada. In 1855 he advanced himself so far forward as to be appointed superintendent of the "Ophir" Mine, and in 1857 be filled the same office for the "Hale and Norcross" Company.</p>
        <p>It was while in this employment that the future "Bonanza " Tetrarch made his first "pile." By his counsels James Flood agreed with him to secure control of a piece of mining property known as the White and Murphy and Kenny grounds or claims. This ground, then purchased for a 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 387" />small sum comparatively, covers all the treasures of the "Bonanza" mines of California and Consolidated Virginia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fair, though no "second-sighted" man or wizard, it seems, prognosticated all that has since been developed from these two most famous mines in North America. Mr. Fair has been a "very lucky" man, as the disappointed stockholders call him; but his "luck" all came from his deep calculating mind, and from the indomitable perseverance of his vigorous Celtic energy. He is now very wealthy, and, besides his money, owns million's worth of real estate in this city and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>He still superintends the "Bonanza" mines, as well as the Hale and Norcross, the Occidental and other mines. His income is said to be about $540,000 a month, and, though so fabulously rich, he performs the laborious duties of his offices, and is a plain, unassuming man, very little changed from his original honest, Irish manners. He has the reputation of being hospitable and generous to charitable institutions, and is one of the most popular of our wealthy men on the Pacific coast.</p>

        <p>HON. D. J. OLIVER, JOS. A. DONOHOE, RALSTON, ED.</p>
        <p>J. MARTIN, C. D. SULLIVAN, MYLES D. SWEENEY, ED.</p>
        <p>AND RICHARD TOBIN, P. McARAN, Ex-GOVERNOR MA-GILL, M. O'CONNOR, AND CONL. O'CONNOR.</p>
        <p>It cannot be expected that this book should contain memoirs or sketches of all the prominent Irishmen of this State, or even a majority of them. They are numbered by the thousand, and though they are not ambitious of seeing their names in print, yet we deem it but just in this age, when great and good men are scarce, to notice a few of the many of our race who have become distinguished by their virtues.</p>
        <p>JAMES C. FLOOD was born, according to a published memoir of him, in Long Island, New York, in 1827, but probably he is Irish by birth. He came to California in 1849, by sea.</p>
        <p>In 1854, he formed a partnership in the liquor business with William S. O'Brien, Esq., a gentleman of elegant appearance and polite manners. The partnership began in their commercial enterprise, continues to the present 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 389" />time, a strong presumption of the confidence which either has in the integrity of the other.</p>
        <p>In or about the year 1868, they--O'Brien &amp; Flood--joined with Mackey and Fair in mining, and purchased the present bonanza grounds for about $90,000, from White, Lynch, and other Irishmen, who owned the claim. Their successful working of the bonanza mines is well known. The two mines of the Consolidated Virginia and California have yielded about $60,000,000 paid in dividends, which varied from ten dollars a share at first, to two dollars at present, and for the past two years.</p>
        <p>This firm employs 4,000 men at four dollars a day wages on an average. Their monthly pay-roll is $480,000, all paid to white men, and many of them Irishmen. These men, then, ought to get credit for what they are doing. Their enterprise benefits thousands of people and enriches many. They cannot be said to be altogether selfish, if they have an income of millions every month.</p>
        <p>Should their works cease, or remain undeveloped, the population of Virginia City, which is now twenty thousand or so, would not be one thousand if Flood and O'Brien and Mackey and Fair retired to the East or to Europe. They control the Nevada Bank of San Francisco, which has a capital of 
        <pb n="390 The Irish Race in California." />$10,000,000 in gold. They also own millions worth of real estate in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>They are blamed by some critics for not giving a million or two annually to feed and clothe the poor, or because they do not found some grand institution of charity or learning, or build a grand cathedral, in thanksgiving to the Providence which guided them to such wealth; but they may do so before they die.</p>
        <p>To be sure, if they desire immortality on earth even, it is not by hoarding fabulous wealth that they can gain it, but by leaving some lasting monument of charity, which would hand down their names to the end of time.</p>
        <p>Even Girard, the miserly Frenchman, in his ill-advised and eccentric foundation of Girard College, in Philadelphia, has secured himself an earthly fame, increasing from year to year, which immortalizes his name, when the Stewarts, Astors, and Vanderbilts will be forgotten.</p>
        <p>We copy the following paragraphs from the San Francisco News Letter:If we were asked to select from among all the men that California events have brought to the surface, that one upon whose fortune pure chance has had the least influence, we should name the subject of this sketch. James C. Flood was born 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 391" />at New York City about 1828, and is now forty-eight years of age. His education, while not of the highest class, such as can only be obtained in the great universities, is yet sound and practical in all English branches. To this knowledge of his own language Mr. Flood has added, by a general line of reading, a familiarity with the history and literature of the world and a wide acquaintance with passing events. The effect of the gold discoveries of California in 1848-9 was a sort of intellectual conscription, in which the physical and mental energy of the world was drafted into the expedition to this coast. If it had been desired for any reason to select from the youths just arrived at man's estate in the Spring of 1849, the finest and most energetic minds, and to set them aside into a special class, no system of examination would have procured so perfect a choice as was made by natural selection in the struggles of the strongest to get away from home and to find their way to California. In this uprising of youthful ambition James C. Flood pushed out into the great ocean of adventure, and found himself in San Francisco in 1849, a passenger on the ship Elizabeth Ellen. Like most young men of that period, he arrived here with no capital, save his own will and natural forces. How he struggled in the commencement, 
        <pb n="392 The Irish Race in California." />first at one thing and then at another, as chance threw honest employment in his way, to secure subsistence, and, that obtained, to lay up a little capital, it is not necessary to give in detail, for it is substantially the history of any young man of that period arriving here, possessing sufficient spirit and self-reliance to do honest work, rather than depend in any manner upon others. His mind looked for results even at that early day. Whatever employments he may have in the beginning held, he soon threw them aside in his determination to work for himself in the making of his own fortune. As early as 1854 he associated with William S. O'Brien. It was then that they began those mining enterprises that have already resulted in rendering them the first mining capitalists of this, and possibly of any age.</p>
        <p>The first notable enterprise engaged in by Flood &amp; O'Brien consisted in operations in the Kentuck and other mines on the Comstock, in which they generally contrived to secure a controlling interest. This was as early as 1862. Their operations in Hale &amp; Norcross, a few years after, were on a scale so large as to attract general attention to them as mining speculators. But the operation which finally made the name of this mining firm known throughout the world has been compressed within the 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 393" />short space of a few months in the early part of 1875. The existence of those vast bodies of ore in the Consolidated Virginia and California mines which gave them the name of bonanza, thus adding a permanent word to the English language, was suspected as early as February, 1874, and were made certain by the proprietors in December of that year. The generosity with which they dealt with those who had the good fortune to be their friends, is now generally known in this community. They were not content to see their own fortune growing with colossal strides each hour, but desired all who had been kind to them in the past to accompany them on the road to prosperity. Many of our wealthiest people of to-day, if we thought proper to name them, would confess that to the fortunate circumstance of their good relations with Flood &amp; O'Brien in years gone by, they alone attribute their being rich instead of poor.</p>
        <p>The establishment of the Nevada Bank is the idea of Mr. Flood, who has resolved that his bank shall grow up in San Francisco, sound in capital, and with a reputation throughout the world, that shall be built upon genuine merit.</p>
        <p>In appearance, Mr. Flood is prepossessing, strong, and about 5 feet 10 inches high, compactly 
        <pb n="394 The Irish Race in California." />built, and robust form. His complexion is a healthy blonde, with a serious but pleasant demeanor, and a grave and sedate carriage, befitting the earnest nature of the man. It has been remarked by thoughtful men, to whom Mr. Flood has been known from youth, that all he is now was foreshadowed in him from the first; that whatever situation he was placed in for the moment, he was always equal to, and performed his part in a grave, quiet and thoughtful manner, marked rather by force held in reserve than by that actually employed. His bearing towards others was always that of the inborn, natural gentleman, invariably courteous and gentle to all, and never failing to receive like consideration from those he met; inherently confident of his own position, never dreaming that it could be questioned by anybody. And this was in no respect more marked when occupying the humblest position that chance had imposed upon him than now that he is one of the leading capitalists of the country.</p>
        <p>W. S. O'BRIEN, the jolliest millionaire in creation, is to be found in the subject of this sketch. And the reason is simple enough. William S. O'Brien has taken the world easily from the day he entered it a little over forty years ago. It was at Abbeyleix, Queen's Co., Ireland, and that famous 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 395" />isle of the ocean has done many worse things than in giving this man to California. It is understood that Mr. O'Brien is the social member of the firm, draws his dividends, and, laughing at care, waxes daily more plump and debonaire. He arrived in California on the 6th day of July, 1849, in the ship Faralinto, around the Horn, and passed through a probation, not of poverty, for to a man of simple tastes and good habits in California there can be no such thing; but of toil, self denial and devotion to business. His first business connection was with the late Col. William C. Hoff, one of our best known and most honored pioneers. The firm of Hoff &amp; O'Brien continued for two years, when the subject of this sketch retired for the purpose of forming a co-partnership with Wm. J. Rosener, in the ship-chandlery line. In May, 1854, the present firm of Flood &amp; O'Brien was established, and has never been dissolved. It is probably a co-partnership that will only be ended by the hand of the grim monster. A good share of that popularity which laid the foundation of the fame and power of the firm was due to the genial manner and cheerful speech of its junior member. Everybody liked Billy O'Brien, and everybody put entire faith in the integrity of the firm. They were known to be men of capacity and sterling 
        <pb n="396 The Irish Race in California." />worth. In the mining speculations that gradually led up to the present position of the house, Mr. O'Brien has always been a full partner. With rather more of taste for politics than his partner, Mr. Flood, Mr. O'Brien has, as a rule, kept clear of all complications of that kind. Yet once, in 1862, he was tempted by over-zealous friends to stand for the position of Assemblyman. We are happy to say he was defeated, inasmuch as he expressed himself at the time as pleased with the result, and surely he ought to know better than anybody else whether he wanted to go or not. Mr. O'Brien has made a host of friends and relatives happy by the liberal manner in which he disburses his wealth. And what better test of the true gentleman can be found than that shown by the fact that he enjoys the happiness of others. Mr. O'Brien is -- years old and a bachelor. But not one perversely set on remaining without the pale of matrimony. On the contrary, we feel at liberty to say to the fair sex of our State, damsels and widows, that he is susceptable [sic], and that nothing in the world would be easier than drawing to terms and capturing this, one of the richest single gentlemen to-day in America. Verbum sat. sap.</p>
        <p>The career of Mr. O'Brien is one well worthy of study and imitation on the part of young men.</p>
        <p>&lt;illustration&gt;HON. D. J. OLIVER.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 397" />We might say that it indicates as plainly as the life of a man can, the injunction to the rising youth of the country to press forward, and hold to the faith that, in the end, energy, integrity of purpose and real talent will surmount all difficulties, and force position and a recognition from the world.</p>
        <p>HON. D. J. OLIVER is one of the most successful, as well as the most accomplished, Irish gentlemen on the Pacific coast, or on the continent. By this statement we don't mean to assert that he is the richest man, or a great statesman, or a famous general. He is what is far more creditable--a good Christian, a good citizen and an honest man, who is an honor to the land which gave him birth, as well as to the race to which he belongs. Chevalier Oliver was born in Galway, that famous home of ancient nobility, in the year 1823, and came to the United States before he was 18 years of age. He was married in '40 to Miss McGlynn, a lady of the highest qualities of mind and heart. [sic] a native of Donegal, and sister to the Rev. Dr. McGlynn, a very distinguished clergyman of New York. He was knighted by His Holiness Pio Nono in 1849--an honor which princes aspire to in Europe--and two of his children, Mary Agnes and Joseph, received their first communion from the Holy Father himself, and a prelate, Monsignor 
        <pb n="398 The Irish Race in California." />Paca, assisted at the service and Father Smith of Propaganda. Mr. Oliver presented the Pope with a silver brick of $6,000 value, and it was out of the virgin silver of that brick, that the silver medals were struck to commemorate the Vatican Council. The Italian Government, with their usual rapacity, seized on the brick, which the Chevalier had to purchase back again at a cost of $5,000 more. Mr. Oliver has had ten children, four only of whom survive. His amiable and affectionate wife is also deceased.</p>
        <p>Unlike some few others of his countrymen, who ignore their ancestors after getting rich, Mr. Oliver is proud of his nationality and the land of his nativity, though he is of Norman descent, like the De Courcys, Prendergasts, Fitzgeralds, and others who boasted they were "more Irish than the native Irish." The Book of Heraldry traces the Olivers back to the era of the Norman Conquest, 1060, when William invaded England and subdued the Saxons at the battle of Hastings. After that decisive battle Henry Oliver, who fought there, was knighted by King William, and received a grant of land in Wiltshire. William Oliver, a son of the former, came over to Ireland with the Earl of Pembroke, named Strongbow, and his descendants became naturalized, and 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 399" />adopted in time the customs and the language of the native Irish. It was in allusion to the bravery of this family that the expression came, "give him a Roland for an Oliver." It is a remarkable circumstance that, as the first Oliver who landed in England was knighted by William the Conqueror, so, after a period of eight hundred years, the representative of that old family has been knighted by the acknowledged source of all genuine nobility in the civilized world, the Pope of Rome. How is it that times change and men die, but principles are eternal and never change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oliver's innate modesty and repugnance to anything savoring of praise precludes us from any further allusion to his worth as a citizen and high qualifications as a gentleman.</p>
        <p>The late MR. McMAHON O'BRIEN was, and his surviving brothers are, of the same family as the Marquis of Thomond, Lord Inchiquin. In fact, their branch of the family ought, by right, to inherit the estate now possessed by Sir Lucius, the present or late Lord Inchiquin, the brother of Smith O'Brien. The division of the family took place in the sixteenth century, when the Dromoland branch adopted the English policy and creed and those who remained faithful to the Old traditions forfeited their estates.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="400 The Irish Race in California." />John O'Brien, Esq., grandfather of the subject of this sketch, though stripped of the lordly hereditory [sic] estates, yet retained those of Toonagh, New Hall and Edenvale, in Clare, and was acknowledged, even by the Drumoland family, as of the same origin with themselves. McMahon O'Brien's father emigrated from Ireland and made America his home while his children were young, and did not long live after his arrival. The children all got a sound, solid education.</p>
        <p>After having faithfully served under the Stars and Stripes till the end of the war, Mr. O'Brien came out to California, where, notwithstanding his feeble health, the consequence of the severity of his military career, he soon became conspicuous as a banker and financier. He was connected with the Hibernia Savings Bank for some years, and discharged the duties of his position with entire satisfaction to the members of that corporation. Afterwards he established the Dime Savings Bank, on Market street, where he did a large business, and during the severe run made on him, after the failure of the Pioneer and other similar fraudulent institutions, the Dime Bank bravely held out and paid all those who called for their money. By his prompt action Mr. O'Brien saved his credit and his honor. And it was not till after his death 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 401" />that the institution, of which he was the principal support, went into liquidation. He died in the month of December, and his remains were followed to Lone Mountain by a very large concourse of citizens. R. I. P.</p>
        <p>JAMES A. DONOHOE, ESQ., banker, is a native of New York, and was trained to the dry goods business in his early days. He was employed as clerk for some time by the staunch firm of Donnelly &amp; Co., in his native city, and such was the confidence which his employers reposed in his honesty and ability, that in 1846 they sent him to St. Louis to take charge of a second house which the firm of Donnelly &amp; Co. founded there. In 1849, when the California "fever" broke out like an epidemic, Mr. Donohoe resolved to follow the current which flowed towards the Pacific Coast, and started overland for the "El Dorado." Being not accustomed to the rough treatment, attendant of such a mode of traveling as the overland route then presented, Mr. Donohoe got sick and was obliged to lay over at Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he was at the point of death. He recovered, however, slowly, and instead of continuing his overland route, returned to New York, from which city he started by sea, and reached California by the steamer Oregon in the autumn of that year.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="402 The Irish Race in California." />In 1862, he entered into a partnership with Eugene Kelly &amp; Co., in this city, in commercial business.</p>
        <p>In 1862 Eugene Kelly and he, with William Ralston, started a bank which had great success as a bank of discount for several years. In '64 Ralston retired from the bank and became connected with the California Bank. The Donohoe, Kelly &amp; Co.'s Bank continues, however, and stands in the first class as a safe institution. James A. Donohoe had also an interest with his namesake's, Peter Donahue &amp; Brothers, in the Gas Works, and also in the Occidental Hotel, one of the first-class houses of San Francisco. Mr. Donohoe is, and has been for years, president of the Board of Trade, the duties of which be discharges with great satisfaction and regularity. Mr. Donohoe, like his partner Eugene Kelly, is one of those men whom wealth and prosperity have not made proud. He is a gentleman of the most pleasing manners; benevolence and goodness of heart, the usual accompaniments of nobility of soul, are reflected in his manly countenance.</p>
        <p>The late WILLIAM RALSTON was of unmistakable Irish origin, his ancestors having come from Ulster, where the name is common, to the United States, and settled in Pennsylvania. He was born and brought up, of course, in America, but he retained 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 403" />the characteristic virtues, and not a few of the faults, of his Celtic ancestors.. He was generous, but his generosity bordered on extravagance. His speculations were bold and hazardous. He was liberal to a fault, but his acts of benevolence were performed without discrimination, and the most unworthy were often the recipients of his bounty. Though nurtured in poverty, and familiar with want in his youth, yet when he became wealthy, riches did not change his generous disposition, nor did vulgar pride transform him into a selfish despiser of the poor. He had some faults, but they were hidden from public view by the dazzling halo of his most conspicuous virtues. Even his vices had a dash of liberality about them which deprived them of more than half of their depravity. His first employment was as a farm hand, and from that honest occupation, after some schooling acquired at brief intervals, he became a steamboat man. His next employment was on the Panama Railroad, and to secure the position, he had to borrow a small sum of money--$500--which he afterwards paid by remitting the sender, who reposed confidence in his honesty, ten thousand dollars! We find him next in San Francisco, a partner with Eugene Kelly, Donohoe &amp; Co., as a banker. From that institution he went out to be president of the 
        <pb n="404 The Irish Race in California." />Bank of California, in which position, becoming somewhat embarassed [sic], he fell to rise no more, except in the grateful memories of the thousands whom his liberality, genius, and enterprise had elevated to fortunes or saved from ruin. The genius of commercial prosperity seemed to have perched upon his standard in the battle for wealth, and when his sun set the gloom of commercial decay, like a threatening cloud, seemed to have gathered and rested over the city. The memory of his faults will soon die away from the minds of the people, while his virtues and benefactions as a public man will become more brilliant by age, like an old mosaic picture which the inroads of time serve but to make more resplendent. The Palace Hotel will stand a lasting monument to his genius, while his many acts of benevolence, public and private, will keep his memory alive, as one who deserved well of his race and his country.</p>
        <p>HON. E. T. MARTIN claims a place among the distinguished Irishmen of this Coast, from his success and position. He is a native of Enniscorthy, in Wexford, and the first lessons of patriotism which he learned were impressed in his sensitive mind under the shadows of the celebrated "Vinegar Hill," where the Irish revolutionists made the last stand, for liberty and native land, against the 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 405" />hired soldiery of Britain. Mr. Martin's ancestors, both at the father's and mother's side--the latter of whom were Johnstons--fought on the side of liberty and national independence, and young Martin had repeated lessons from his parents concerning the "lost cause." Seeing no prospect for national independence, Edward Martin, before reaching his majority, emigrated, and his destina- [sic] was Santiago, in Chili.</p>
        <p>There he spent five years in commercial business, for which he was qualified by the education he received at home, and in '49 he determined to come to California. Accordingly, he set out on a sailing vessel and reached San Francisco after a voyage of six months. Having arrived, he lost no time in speculative deliberation, but at once went into mining in Calaveras County, where he soon accumulated a handsome fortune by his enlightened industry. He then made a tour to Ireland, and visited on his return the principal Eastern cities, such as New York, Chicago and St. Louis, and on mature deliberation, concluded that San Francisco was his future home. He has been engaged in commercial pursuits here since 1850, and now he stands forth as one of the most successful Irishmen of the State. We believe he is the largest land-holder of our race in the United States, own- 
        <pb n="406 The Irish Race in California." />ing, as he does, over 600,000 acres in one body in Oregon, and about 200,000 in this State.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin is in the prime of life, being about fifty-two years of age, and has a large family, highly educated and instructed under the care of his accomplished wife Eleanor, a sister of Governor Downey. Mr. Martin's appearance indicates the true Irish gentleman, for he has in his physiognomy that mixture of dignity and wit which characterizes the genuine Irishman. He is one of the original founders of the Hibernia Savings Bank corporation, of which, we believe, he is the secretary, and his reputation for integrity and prudence stands first class in this great city. His career should be held up to our young countrymen, as well to admire as to imitate, for it proves what can be done by individual efforts when accompanied by sound principles of integrity, honor and perseverance. Here we behold a young man quitting his native home, where he was carefully reared by his pious parents under the pleasing shadows of the historic hills of his native country, and undertaking a voyage to the opposite side of the globe to better his condition and to raise himself to a position which his native country denied him. And we find him, in little over a quarter of a century, enjoying an independence and property 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 407" />which, in ordinary circumstances, it would take ages to acquire. And all this property and all those riches have been accumulated by honest industry and prudent speculation before that young man becomes aged, infirm or debilitated. If such an example is not worthy of imitation and creditable to our race in California or elsewhere we know not where to find one.</p>
        <p>Such is the gentleman whose name is given at the head of this brief sketch, and of whom we have said so little, from the fact that the innate modesty of his youth still clings to the man and makes him averse to public notice. We feel that we have not done this gentleman justice in this brief sketch, which, though authentic, is far from being full, from the cause alluded to above, namely, his aversion to egotism or praise. But in a book concerning the "Irish Race in California," to omit E. T. Martin or men of his stamp, would be to fall short of what we intended, and to omit what our readers are supposed to expect to find in the pages of such a work.</p>
        <p>We cannot say, ex uno disce omnes, or that all have had a like success with Martin; but we can say, that it was possible for many, if not for all, to have an equal success, if they had only the qualifications, judgment and prudence, which ever 
        <pb n="408 The Irish Race in California." />distinguished our greatest Irish land-owner, E. T. Martin.</p>
        <p>MYLES D. SWEENY, ESQ., one of the most prominent founders of the Hibernia Bank of San Francisco, is a native of Tyrconnell, in Donegal, and came to the United States about fifty years ago. His father emigrated first and made a home for his family in Pennsylvania as early as 1826. Pennsylvania at that early day was sought by most of the men of the North of Ireland, from the fact that, since its first settlement under the Quaker Penn, a large portion of its inhabitants were of Irish birth or descent. The foundation of Mr. Sweeny's success was laid in Philadelphia, from which he emigrated with his family in '49, reaching San Francisco early in '50.</p>
        <p>The "O'Suanaghs" were an old clan, distinguished for the number of prelates and abbots which they gave the church, as early, even, as the eighth century. Anno 751 we read that Luanus O'Swanye died at Rathin, now , Rahen, in the King's County, where there was a famous monastry [sic]. The subject of this brief notice, however, is descended of a northern branch of the same old sept. He has the blood of the Q'Donnells in his veins and one of his maternal ancestors, named Daly, came to America in Colonial times&lt;illustration&gt;C. D. O'SULLIVAN, ESQ.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 409" />and fought in the Revolutionary war against the ancient foe of his country and race. Mr. Sweeny has been in this State, as already noticed, since 1850, and was elected to the office of Supervisor more than once, almost against his will. It may be said of him, that he never solicited office, and though a prominent man, from his position, enterprise and wealth, he may be put down as one who has had no ambition for public life.</p>
        <p>Many interesting circumstances of this honest man's life could be related to illustrate the best traits of our race. But from his reluctance to have anything said of him that may savor of praise, we must be silent regarding them. He shuns notoriety and public notice, and we must therefore leave him alone in his glory, with the reputation of being "an honest man, the noblest work of God."CORNELIUS D. O'SULLIVAN, ESQ., of San Francisco, is a native of the County of Cork, Ireland, from which he emigrated in '45 or '46, after having witnessed the horrors of the famine created by the misrule of the British government. Descended from the brave old stock of which Donal O'Sullivan Beare was the type, young Con., no doubt, tore himself with reluctance from the land of his 
        <pb n="410 The Irish Race in California." />love and nativity. But what could he do when he saw full-grown men fall down dead on the streets and highways, while there was food enough in the country, but in the possession of tyrants, sufficient to support twice the population of the country in luxury if the people were allowed to use it. The people were not told, as they ought to be instructed, that, in cases of extreme necessity, no laws are binding save those of nature and self-preservation. Hence, the people died in millions from a false idea of the rights of property, which they were taught to respect at the sacrifice of their lives. The rich are only the stewards of the property God gives them to see that the poor may not want, and when they neglect this duty, imposed on them by Providence as guardians and trustees, then the people have a right to save their lives by seizing on the abundance around them to keep themselves from starvation.</p>
        <p>Young O'Sullivan, when he could do no better, concluded to emigrate, and accordingly landed in New Orleans over thirty years ago. He had not a heavy purse after having landed, but he had stalworth limbs and a stout heart, and in less than three years he was engaged as a cotton broker in the city where sugar and cotton are supreme articles of commerce.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 411" />Hearing of the discovery of gold in California, in '48, he settled up his affairs and, accompanied by his accomplished wife, started for this city by the Isthmus route and landed here early in 1849.</p>
        <p>Immediately on his arrival, he engaged in mining and commercial business, and soon became independent. He was one of the original founders of the Hibernia Bank, and remains to this day one of its principal directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Sullivan, as can be seen from his portrait, is a man of marked character, and in his physiognomy unmistakably favors that mixture of humor, wit and stern determination which distinguished all the O'Sullivans, from the Hero of Beare Haven to the distinguished subject of our sketch. He resides in a palatial mansion at the junction of Bush and Hyde streets, where his wife, a lady of true Irish dignity and rare benevolence, exercises her matronly sway over a large family of some ten in number.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Sullivan is one of our most successful citizens of Irish birth, and worth, probably, millions, all earned by honest industry and prudent investments. He keeps many servants and men in his employment, but unlike others, he never turns his back on the men of his race, and not a dollar of his wealth was acquired through the employment 
        <pb n="412 The Irish Race in California." />of cheap coolie labor. Hence, and from his hospitable style of living, he is called, by countrymen, "the Irish lord," though he makes no pretensions to any such titles, but wishes to be known as simple Con. O'Sullivan. Another public virtue of his must not be omitted, namely, that he never had or sought any political office. His wealth has been acquired by individual enterprise, without the aid of "rings" or political machinations. All his honors are his own, and may he wear them long and worthily.</p>
        <p>ROBERT AND RICHARD TOBIN, brothers and partners, are men of mark in this community, and have earned a reputation for ability and honesty which places them in the first rank among business men. They are natives of Carrig-on-Suir, in Tipperary, but having come to this country before reaching their majority, their business education has been acquired in part at least, in California. Robert, we understand, was the first who arrived in California, having come from Chili in the same vessel with E. T. Martin. They have been connected with the Hibernia Bank from its institution, and much of the security and confidence which the public repose in the Bank is owing to the well-known legal ability of the Messrs. Tobin. The Tobins came over with William the Conquerer [sic] 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 413" />from Normandy, and like the Pendergasts, Daltons, Olivers and Fitzgeralds, were attracted to Ireland in the twelfth century. They were powerful lords within the Pale in the fourteenth century, but soon adopted the customs and language of the Irish, with whom they have ever since been identified. The name, it is said, is derived from "Aubin," a canonized saint afterwards, a native of Normandy, who came over as chaplain in William's expedition. The change from "Aubin," pronounced "Obin," would be easily made to Tobin in the Gaelic.</p>
        <p>The name Tobin is by no means scarce in Munster, and it is well represented in this city by Senator Tobin, James Tobin, of 1009 Pine street, and several merchants.</p>
        <p>P. MACARAN, ESQ., is another official of the Hibernia Bank, and is a native of Fermanagh. He came at an early age to visit his uncle, a wealthy farmer near Saratoga, N. Y., and emigrated to this State in 1852. He has become a rich capitalist by his industry and honest thrift, and is of good standing among our citizens. He has an interesting family, and is one of those men whom wealth has not made proud or overbearing. Such men deserve a double meed of honor; first, for their persevering industry, and, next, for pre- 
        <pb n="414 The Irish Race in California." />serving their native dignity of character in spite of the temptations of wealth.</p>
        <p>EX-GOVERNOR HENRY M. McGILL is of Irish birth, and came to the United States with his parents when a child of five or six years. Subsequently he visited Ireland with his parents, and after an absence of some years the family returned in 1848-9, residing in Washington City, D. C. In his earlier years he filled several important positions in the departments at Washington.</p>
        <p>On the incoming of the administration of President Buchanan he was appointed, first, as assistant, and was afterwards, for some time, Acting Private Secretary to the President, by whom and the members of the Cabinet he was held in high esteem and confidence, as is evidenced by correspondence in his possession.</p>
        <p>In 1859 Mr. McGill was admitted as a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, and was also appointed one of the Commissioners of the Court of Claims. Near the close of 1859 he was commissioned by the President (and subsequently confirmed by the Senate) as Secretary of the Territory of Washington, and at once proceeded, accompanied by his wife and children, to the scene of his new duties.</p>
        <p>In 1860 he became the Acting Governor of the 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 415" />Territory, and upon his retirement from the position, under President Lincoln, the press of the Territory, without distinction of party, joined in commending the ability of his administration.</p>
        <p>His correspondence with Governor Douglas, of Vancouver Island, upon matters arising under the extradition treaty, and his adjustment of the question as to the right of the Territory to collect taxes from the Hudson Bay Company on San Juan Island, during its joint occupancy, form an important chapter in the history of the Territory.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGill, as Acting-Governor, was the fourth executive officer of Washington Territory, and was a warm personal friend of Governor Isaac I. Stevens, the first Governor, and subsequently delegate in Congress.</p>
        <p>On the outbreak of the war, Governor McGill, in response to the first proclamation of President Lincoln calling for volunteers, took immediate steps for the organization of the Territorial militia, in which he was warmly aided by his friend Governor Stevens. On his removal from office by President Lincoln, Governor McGill resumed the practice of his profession, in the Territory, and was subsequently elected Prosecuting Attorney and member of the Territorial Assembly. He was also President of the Board of Regents of the Territorial 
        <pb n="416 The Irish Race in California." />University at Seattle. While Governor, Mr. McGill was also Disbursing Agent of the appropriations made by Congress for the erection of the Territorial Capitol and other public buildings, and the first steps taken toward their construction were taken during his administration.</p>
        <p>In 1857 Mr. McGill came to San Francisco, where he has since resided. Governor McGill is a gentleman of cultivated intellect and pleasing refinement and manners. He is a good specimen of the elegant Irish-American citizen overlaying a chivalrous Irish aristocrat.</p>
        <p>The memory of Governor McGill is still cherished in Washington Territory, for he came away from there without a suspicion against his patriotism, his honesty or honor.</p>
        <p>CORNELIUS O'CONNOR, ESQ., connected with the firm of Flood &amp; O'Brien, is another man of our race, who has carved his way to eminence by his native abilities and worth. He is a native of Kerry, and as distinguished by his private benevolent acts, as he is remarkable for his success as a capitalist. He is descended from one of the purest branches of the last monarchs of Ireland, the "O'Connor Kerry" clan.</p>
        <p>JAMES PHELAN is a gentleman who has risen to wealth and independence as a merchant, within a 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 417" />few years, in this city. Mr. Phelan is a Leinsterman, a native of the Queen's County, and has resided here since '49. He is worth millions, and all has been acquired by his own industry and strict attention to business.</p>
        <p>J. A. FARRELLY, secretary of the Hibernia Savings Bank, is a native of Cavan, and has been connected with the bank since its foundation,Mr. Farrelly is a man of liberal views and highly educated, not only as a man of business, but also well versed in classics and the modern languages. His education was finished in Italy, and his gentlemanly demeanor points him out as one well fitted to discharge the important office which he fills at the Bank.</p>

        <p>OUR LEADING CLERGYMEN. THEIR NATURAL REPUGNANCETO PRAISE. THE CLERGY OF THE PACIFIC COAST ANDTHE VIRTUES THAT DISTINGUISH THEM. THEIR HAR-MONY AND EFFICIENCY. THE NAMES OF LEADING CLER-GYMEN. WHERE THEY OFFICIATE AND WHERE EDU-CATED, ETC.</p>
        <p>In giving memoirs or biographical notices of clergymen care must be taken not to offend the modesty that belongs to them, as a class, by any sort of eulogy that would savor of flattery. Hence, our sketches of those reverend gentlemen whom we shall introduce to grace our pages shall be plain, brief and free from all taint of exaggeration.</p>
        <p>We have noticed, since we came to this coast, that a very remarkable harmony exists among the clergy of all denominations. We seldom hear of any lectures or invectives against the religion of their neighbors by over-zealous preachers, as is too frequently the case in the Eastern States, or was in past times. People here, even in religion, have come to the conclusion to "live and let live," and their common sense 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 419" />teaches them that to attack your neighbor's religion or his character is a pitiable way to defend your own.</p>
        <p>The state of feeling among the Catholic clergy and the great harmony that evidently pervades that body are due, in a great measure, to the prudence and piety of the venerable Archbishop, whose mildness and justice ever accompany every act of his administration. His administration of this diocese and "province" is probably the only one that has never been disturbed by the disobedience of a single subject, or even unfavorably commented on or criticized; and this unusual, but happy condition of affairs, we imagine, arises from the fact that the Archbishop follows out in spirit, and according to the letter, the recommendations of the Holy Father to prelates in America, namely, that all congregations, of whatever tongue or nationality, should have priests of their own country and kin to officiate to the. This the Archbishop carries out most fairly, and this as well as his well known piety, makes him very popular with his clergy of all nationalities, but with none so much as with the priests of our race. There is not, perhaps, in the Church, a Bishop, save "John of Tuam," more generally beloved by his priests, than the Archbishop of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="420 The Irish Race in California." />This example of the Archbishop here ought to to [sic] be followed by all bishops, both because the advice comes from the Chair of Peter, as well as from the notorious fact that, where the opposite rule is followed--as it is in many parts which we could, but won't mention--religion lags, stands still and even retrogrades; and what else could be expected, where the priest speaks a tongue which the people don't understand? A stranger who listens to a preacher who cannot make himself understood, becomes disgusted with the manner and the subject of the discourse at once, and leaves the sacred place, with a resolution never again to come to "hear such stuff."Besides, the Catholic clergy, we believe, are remarkable for exemption from the fault of untimely polemical disputations; they generally defend their own creed if attacked, but seldom, if ever, do they assail what they consider the errors of those who differ with themselves in belief. This shows their good sense and secures them public approbation.</p>
        <p>The late REV. JOHN McGINNIS was a native of of [sic] the County of Meath, Ireland, in the townland of Dunleek. He got his classical education in Ireland and a portion of his theological training, but was ordained priest by Bishop England, Charleston, in 1839 or '40; but owing to the unsalubrity of 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 421" />South Carolina, he left there in '47, and came under the jurisdiction of Bishop Hughes, of New York, who immediately appointed him pastor of a large congregation in St. James, in that city.</p>
        <p>After having discharged the functions of parish priest for about five years, he came to San Francisco, in March, 1850. In this city he was placed in charge of St. Patrick's congregation, which then worshiped in an old building called the Belvidero, at the corner of Jessie and Fourth streets. He built the first St. Patrick's, named by him after Ireland's patron saint. He continued for fourteen years pastor of St. Patrick's, laboring zealously, and almost incessantly for the well-being, spiritual and temporal, of those committed to his care. He was beloved by his congregation and esteemed by citizens of all creeds. He was indefatigable in his labors, and unwearied in his attentions to the care of the sick, the poor, and the destitute. He was a father to the orphans, and Mount St. Joseph's will stand a lasting monument to his charity and zeal. He was in San Francisco during the "flush times" for acquiring property and accumulating treasure, but like St. Laurence of old, he could boast that his orphans were his riches--his treasure. He died poor, and was called foolish because he was so careless of his personal 
        <pb n="422 The Irish Race in California." />interests. But he gloried in his own infirmities while he was most attentive to the well-being and comfort of his orphans. He died in 1866, and his remains repose in Lone Mountain. R. I. P.</p>
        <p>The McGinnis family was a most ancient one in Ulster. They belonged to the "Clan Aodh," or the tribe of Hugh. They gave their name to a large territory in County Down. They were a brave, obstinate race, and implacable enemies of the Saxons and other foreign invaders.</p>
        <p>RIGHT REV. EUGENE O'CONNELL, Bishop of Grass Valley, is a native of Meath, Ireland, and was educated in Maynooth. He was for several years connected with the missionary college at Drumcondra, near Dublin, in the very important capacity of Dean. The discipline of the institution was entirely under his control, and though he was most exact in the enforcement of the rules of the College, his administration was very popular among the students. After spending years in the College, perfecting its discipline and securing its financial success, he came out on the California mission, where he labored as a zealous priest among the Spanish as well as the Irish population, having great fluency of delivery in the Castilian as well as the Anglo-Saxon tongue. Father O'Connell's remarkable piety and extraordinary zeal soon at- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 423" />tracted the attention of his ecclesiastical superiors, and he was consecrated Bishop of Grass Valley, Feb. 3, 1861. He is a man of a very mortified appearance, his austerities evidently showing on his countenance, and hence the great veneration in which he is held by his people. Bishop O'Connell is a practical theologian of deep research and extensive study; he is, besides, profoundly acquainted with the writings of the ancient and modern classical authors. He devotes many hours daily to study and devotion, and commands the love and veneration of his clergy, as well as the general esteem of all his people.</p>
        <p>VERY REV. JOHN PRENDERGAST, V. G. of the Diocese of San Francisco, is a native of Tipperary, and has been in charge of congregations ever since his ordination. Though comparatively a young man, under forty, he is distinguished by a remarkable gravity of manners, and this, with his unassuming piety, renders his discourses very impressive. He has refused the mitre more than once, a rare instance of humility in this selfish age, and, we understand, went all the way to Rome to assure the ecclesiastical authorities there that he desired no higher distinction in the Church than to be a priest at God's altar. But above all his virtues--and they are many-- 
        <pb n="424 The Irish Race in California." />Father Prendergast's charity rises conspicuous. All his slender revenues received in the way of trifling perquisites, are expended in relieving the wants of the poor. He has no bank account or no certificates of stocks. In truth, he is the poorest priest on the coast, as well as the most modest, and this is no small praise in this age of the worship of gold. He has been known to sell his books, and even articles of art and vertu to relieve the poor with the money brought him by their sale. In a word, the very reverend gentlemen is regarded as a model priest and deserves to get the title of the Apostle of Charity on this coast. Father Prendergast, as his name indicates, must have Norman blood in his veins, but after 600 years of naturalization in Erin, and a mixture of Milesian blood from the female side of the family of Prendergasts, they became what they gloried in in after times, "Hibernis ipsis Hiberncones." More Irish than the original Irish.</p>
        <p>VERY REV. PATRICK MANOGUE, Vicar General of the Diocese of Grass Valley and pastor of the Catholic Cathedral of Virginia City, Nev., is a native of Tipperary. His family name, though represented to be of Spanish origin is, on the contrary, of pure Irish origin, and, unlike many old names, has 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 425" />not changed, even in its orthography, during a period of one thousand years. Men of that name stand high in the ecclesiastical annals of Erin. There were priests, and poets too, of the name as early as the eighth century. One of the most distinguished, however, was the Prince Bishop "Cleirchen O'Maneoc," of Leighlin, a predecessor of Dr. Doyle. He was called "the head of the piety of Osraighe," and another account of him bestows the epithet of "the ecclesiastical upholder of all Ireland." He died in the year 1050.</p>
        <p>Father Manogue worthily represents that ancient family, and, without any flattery, may be called "the head of the piety" of the State of Nevada. He may not accept the weight of a mitre, like his namesake of the eleventh century, though he certainly displays, in his vicarial administration of the diocese in which he resides, that he possesses, in no stint measure, the virtues and other qualifications of a bishop. Father Manogue is a most popular clergyman with all classes of the community in which be resides. He has hosts of friends and not one enemy. The flourishing state of religion in Virginia City and the widespread influence which he exercises over his own congregation, composed of people of various 
        <pb n="426 The Irish Race in California." />nationalities, are the fruits of his prudence, piety and zeal. The rebuilding of his fine church, destroyed by fire, in more than its former elegance, and that in a time of financial troubles, proves Father Manogue to be a man of no common administrative ability.</p>
        <p>VERY REV. THOMAS CROKE, who was so long administrator of the affairs of the diocese under the Archbishop, and is at present director of the St. Vincent's Institution at San Rafael, was among the earliest Irish clergymen on this coast. At a time when he had bright prospects of advancement in his native diocese, he volunteered to come to Oregon with Bishop Blanchett, while in college in Paris. He spent several years of the best days of his life in Oregon, Montana and Idaho, preaching the Gospel to Indians and half-breeds, and had many providential escapes from perils encountered in the discharge of his sacred calling. He had to travel hundreds of miles, on horseback and with snowshoes, among savages with no protection or comfort. Father Croke, therefore, in volunteering for the Indian missions of Oregon and the Northwest, sacrificed as much as any man, brought up in competence, independence and refinement, could sacrifice. Father Croke's family has been remarkable for the religious inclinations of its members.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 427" />Three of the brothers became priests, and two or three of the sisters nuns. James, the Archbishop of Cashel, is among the ablest of the prelates speaking the English tongue, and was distinguished from his boyhood for scholarship and the facility with which he mastered the sciences. Even in Rome he took the first prize for learning from competitors from all nations. He is an ornament to the Irish church.</p>
        <p>Father Croke is, we understand, a native of Tralee, but was educated, in his earlier years, in Charleville, County Cork, where his uncle Thomas, was a venerable parish priest for over thirty years.</p>
        <p>This sketch is necessarily imperfect from the fact that Father Croke's humility would not allow him to give any information regarding himself or his family which would savor of anything like praise. The above is written from our own knowledge and our personal recollection of the parish priest of Charleville, who was our spiritual director for a time, as well as from what is generally known by the public regarding this distinguished family. Had riches or wealth any attractions for Father Croke he might have been a millionaire; but he was indifferent to all things save the salvation of souls, and hence he is poor, without any property save his virtues.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="428 The Irish Race in California." />VERY REV. THOMAS J. DALTON, of Grass Valley, is a native of Ireland, from the Province of Leinster. He has labored with great success as a missionary priest among the mining population of a wide district of country in Nevada and other counties of California. His duties were very severe, especially before roads were laid out among the mountains, for then the traveling had all to be done on foot or on horseback. It may be with truth said of him that he spent one-half of his time in the saddle, going around among the different camps among the miners. He has had frequently very providential escapes from serious accident in crossing rivers and traveling over snow-covered ravines and precipices, not to mention perils from ferocious wild animals and men not much less savage than wild beasts. He has finally settled down at Grass Valley, in charge of a very good congregation, who love and obey Father Dalton with the docility of children.</p>
        <p>He has established a community of Sisters at Grass Valley, who take charge of all the orphans of the diocese, and who, besides, conduct a very successful academy for the education of young ladies.</p>
        <p>Father Dalton, though young in years--about forty-two--is venerable in appearance, the cares of 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 429" />his sacred office giving him the premature marks of old age. He is a most estimable clergyman, and very popular among his brethren, not only of his diocese, but even of the State.</p>
        <p>REV. JAMES HUNT, who is Father Dalton's assistants [sic], is a young priest of distinguished accomplishments. He is a native of Kerry, the ancient Ciaraigue-Luchra, the refuge and asylum of Ireland's scholars and olaves during the dark days of Saxon persecution. Father Hunt is very popular with the congregation among whom he officiates, and he deserves their respect from his well-known zeal and virtues.</p>
        <p>The REV. WILLIAM GLEESON, of Brooklyn, or East Oakland, is a native of Tipperary, across the Shannon from Killaloe, the Cill-Dalua of olden times, the seat of royalty and sanctity. The family name goes back into the twilight of history, when Ireland attracted the scholars of all Europe to her shores by the fame of her schools. The Gleisains were, in the ninth century, princes of Ui Macaille, the modern Imokilly in the south of Munster.</p>
        <p>The pastor of East Oakland came of a family remarkable for the number of subjects which it supplied the Church, as priests and religious.</p>
        <p>By the mother's side his ancestor were of a very respectable stock--the Degans--Michael 
        <pb n="430 The Irish Race in California." />Degan, Esq., of Ballina, Rev. William Gleeson's maternal grandfather, was a gentleman in every sense of the word, a wealthy land-holder, and very popular among the people of both Tipperary and Clare, gentry as well as peasantry. Neither the means nor the disposition, therefore, were wanting by Father Gleeson's parents to give him a thorough education. Being dedicated from his infancy to the service of the Church by his pious mother, neither pains nor expense were spared to bring him up in a manner worthy of his high vocation. He received his classical and preparatory education in the schools of his native county, and finished his studies in the missionary college of All Hallows, which he entered in order to prepare for the East Indian Mission, in which he labored very successfully for several years.</p>
        <p>The severity of the climate of British India having threatened to cut of his career of usefulness, he finally choose California as the field of his useful labors. Having spent some years in St. Mary's College as professor, he addressed himself to the laborious task of writing the "History of the Catholic Church in California," a work of large size and deep research and very creditably written. He was, soon after the publication of his work, placed in charge of the missions, Brooklyn 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 431" />and Alameda, which soon, under his prudent and zealous management, from being merely stations visited occasionally, have risen to be respectable congregations, giving employment and support to two zealous priests. In Brooklyn, where the congregation consisted only of a few score Catholics on Sundays before Father Gleeson's appointment as parish priest, there are now two large congregations of at least one thousand persons on Sundays and a splendid convent has been erected at a cost of some ten thousand dollars through the labors of Father Gleeson. In a word, there are not on the coast more flourishing missions than those under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Wm. Gleeson. Whatever he wants done by his congregation he has only to mention and it is done. The people take pleasure in obeying the instructions of such a pious, unselfish, eloquent and charitable clergyman as Father Gleeson. In a word, he is the only priest who has contributed to the literature of the coast in English, at least, by his history; his hearers say he is the best preacher on the coast, and if all the destitute whom he has liberally relieved from his purse could be assembled together, they would say he was the most charitable man in the country. Dispersit dedit pauperibus.</p>
        <p>REV. JOHN B. McNALLY, assistant priest with 
        <pb n="432 The Irish Race in California." />Father Gleeson, like his parish priest, is a very popular young priest, and entirely devoted to and ready to second the views of his confrere. Father McNally is a gentleman of pleasing manners and elegant address, as well as of uncommon oratorical abilities, and could not fail to command respect and popularity in any congregation. He is a native of Ireland, from Wexford, we believe, and by his genealogy can be traced to the "Hy Nial" branch of the northern Milesians. His mother's name, Doran--"O'Deorain"--were hereditary judges in Leinster, and implicated in the patriotic rising of '98 in Ireland.</p>
        <p>Father McNally is a pathetic preacher and a splendid lecturer, and may be designated as the "fidus Achates" of Father Gleeson in all his religious, educational and other improvements in the missions of Brooklyn and Alameda, which works bear testimony, better than words, to the disinterested piety and prudent zeal of these reverend gentlemen.</p>
        <p>REV. JOSEPH PHELAN, parish priest of Austin, Nevada, is a native of Rathdowney, anciently called Rath-Tamhnach, or Fort of the Green Field, in Queen's County.</p>
        <p>The Phelan --O'Fealains--were kings and chiefs in Ossory and Leinster, and other parts of&lt;illustration&gt;REV. PETER BIRMINGHAM.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 433" />Ireland, from the earliest ages, even before the Christian Era. There was a Phelan, son of Bran, king of Leinster, in the seventh century.</p>
        <p>Father Phelan left home for California in 1857, and remained for nine years to look after some mining interests he engaged in, in order to prosecute his studies for the priesthood, for which he felt he was called by a vocation from heaven. Having succeeded beyond his expectations, he returned to his native land, entered the celebrated seminary of Mount Milleray, in Cappaquin, under the Cistercian order of Monks, and afterwards, when his vocation was proved, he betook himself to All Hallows Missionary College, where, after a four years' course, making in all eight years in college, he was ordained in 1874.</p>
        <p>Father Phelan is not remarkable for very brilliant oratorical powers, but he is distinguished by far more valuable qualifications. He is a pious, zealous, amiable young priest, of the most solid moral principles, and might be not inaptly termed a second "Cur$ of Ars," in Nevada. He aims at nothing extraordinary, but by his mild, gentle and unassuming demeanor, does more, and is calculated to do more for religion, than if his eloquence rivaled that of Demosthenes. Father Phelan, besides his parish church at Austin, built 
        <pb n="434 The Irish Race in California." />by the accomplished Father Monte Verdi, in the year 1867, has several other stations to attend to, which keep him busy at his sacred duties almost continually.</p>
        <p>Austin is a mining town situated about ninety miles South of Battle Mountain Station, on the C. P. Railroad, and has a very respectable number of its leading citizens of Irish birth or descent, among whom we may mention John D. Ryan, Esq., an early settler, and a steady and successful miner. Mr. M. M. Eagan, Esq., who was Mayor of the city, and is also a prominent merchant. R. C. Conlon, Esq., foreman of the famous Manhattan Mining Company, is a first-class mining engineer, who superintends all the mines in that locality. Mr. Conlon fills a place of great responsibility, with credit to himself and the race to which he belongs. Peter Collins is another good Irishman engaged in commercial business. Mr. Collins is a practical friend to his country and race, and a citizen of influence and respect. John Smith, Esq., a successful business man, who is now studying law. He is a man of good ability, and will be an ornament to the legal profession. Frank Morton is also a man of prominence among the Irish-Americans of Austin. There are several others of not less note, such as Thos.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 435" />L. Brennan, County Clerk; James Brennan, City Marshal; Mr. O'Neil, a blacksmith; James Hynes, saddler; together with a long list of energetic miners, such as Martin Igo, John Broderick, George Mills, Charles O'Brien, P. Myles, M. Dugan, P. Laughlin, James Cahill, John Whaley, bricklayer and stonemason; the Finegan Bros [sic], architects and contractors. To end the present imperfect list we will add Daniel O'Kane, a miner and a gentleman every inch. In a word, the Irish citizens of Austin, as a class, stand high in the community. They are a credit to the race from which they sprung, as their pious pastor, Father Phelan, is a credit and an honor to them.</p>
        <p>REV. PETER BERMINGHAM, of St. Patrick's Church, Mission street, and late director of St. Vincent's Asylum, at San Rafael, is a native of Galway, Ireland, from which he emigrated, with his parents, when quite young. He received his education in the United States, as well as his ordination.</p>
        <p>The Berminghams were of Norman descent, and came to Ireland at the time of the English invasion. They were one of those families who, like the Geraldines, soon identified themselves with the interests of the natives, and became more 
        <pb n="436 The Irish Race in California." />Irish and patriotic than the natives of the soil. They changed their manes [names] [sic] from Birmingham to "MacFeoris" or "MacKorish," in order to get rid of the odium of being considered Saxon. This name they assumed from one of the family who was remarkable for bravery, and who was named "Ferois" or "Perous." The clan Feorish were Lords of Carberry, in Kildare, and the monastery of "Manister Feoris," now Edenderry, in the King's County, was founded by that family.</p>
        <p>Father Birmingham is a genuine Birmingham, which is evinced by his high honorable bearing and other accomplishments peculiar to a well-bred gentleman. The Father is a pleasing speaker, and as an elocutionist stands unquestionably at the head of his sacred profession on the coast. He is very popular in his congregation, and endowed with business abilities of no common order. His maternal ancestors were the Barretts of Castlebarret, Corafin, County of Galway, a family of high antiquity and nobility.</p>
        <p>REV. THOMAS GRACE, rector of the Marysville Cathedral, is a native of the County of Wexford, and descended from a most respectable family, though of Norman descent. "Raymond Le Gros" was the first of the family in Ireland, and flourished in the twelfth century. From the epithet "Gros" 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 437" />came the name Grace, according to ancient annals both of "Kilronan" and Donegal. The Grace family, in the course of time, gave many brave, learned men to Motherland. It was one of the name, Colonel Grace, who nobly defended Athlone against Dutch William and his hireling invaders in 1688. The subject of this brief notice received his primary education in the seminaries of his native country, and completed his philosophical and theological studies in the well known college of All Hallows.</p>
        <p>Father Grace has labored in the California mission since his ordination, about ten years past, and labored with great success, for there was never a more popular clergymen in Marysville or on the Pacific Coast, than Father Grace. He possesses all the characteristic virtues of the clergyman, and is graced with all the accomplishments of a refined and well-bred gentleman. He is a universal favorite among his people, because any one can perceive that he has not the slightest leaven of selfishness in his nature. But, besides his natural manly advantages, he is a man thoroughly educated; he is a first-class pulpit orator and a profound theologian, as well as a master in his knowledge of the mathematics and the exact sciences. Rumor has it that his name has been sent to Rome as a candidate 
        <pb n="438 The Irish Race in California." />for the mitre, and if he gets it he will honor it by his many virtues.</p>
        <p>REV. DANIEL MEAGHER, of Nevada City, near Grass Valley, is a native of Ireland, we understand, from the County of Cork. Father Meagher is a gentleman of elegant manners, as well as an exemplary clergyman. He stands high, and deservedly so, not only with his congregation, but with citizens of all religious denominations. Father Meagher is an accomplishsd [sic] scholar, and a very impressive speaker. Hence, his people are well instructed, and religion flourishes in the community over which he presides. The Meaghers were a sept of Tipperary, whose chiefs were lords of Incoran, or Ikerran, and who were always found on the side of virtue and Erin during the struggle for national independence.</p>
        <p>REV. THOMAS O'KANE is a native of Kerry, near Tralee, and came on the California mission about ten years since. Father O'Kane is a perfect model of the Irish priest in every way. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word, as mild and as gentle as a lady, and withal, a well-read and profound scholar. Father O'Kane is most popular among his people, has hosts of friends, and not one enemy living, because, like 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 439" />his Divine Master, his whole life is devoted to acts of charity and benevolence. He is an elegant speaker, but the actions of his daily life are more eloquent in persuading men to become virtuous and good, than if he was gifted with the eloquence of a Demosthenes or a Massillon. One of the O'Kanes was called "Rory Ainshearscair," or "Rodger the Unquiet," but no relation to Father O'Kane, certainly.</p>
        <p>REV. J. J. CALLAN, Pastor of Yreka, Siskiyou County, is a zealous clergyman, extensively known on this coast, where he has spent the best part of his life on the mission. He is an Irishman, a native of Meath, and got his education like most of the priests of this coast, in the already celebrated missionary college of All Hallows, in the suburbs of Dublin. Father Callan has been officiating for more than a dozen years in many of the most laborious missions in the State, and though exposed to all sorts of weather, and many dangers over rivers, mountains, and trackless plains, he is still vigorous in mind and body. The reverend gentleman is a first-class pulpit orator and extempore speaker, and can persuade his audience even to tears by his feeling discourses.</p>
        <p>REV. JAMES CLEARY, parish priest of Petaluma, is a native of Wexford, Ireland. He was 
        <pb n="440 The Irish Race in California." />born in Allenstown, in said county, of very respectable parents. He is now about twenty-eight or thirty years of age. He received his education, secular and ecclesiastical, in Ireland, where he was also ordained a priest, and volunteered for the California Mission. He has been engaged at his sacred duties since 1871, first at Oakland, where he spent two years assisting the venerable Father King, and next in Sonoma County, with his residence at Petaluma, where he still resides.</p>
        <p>Father Cleary is one of those men who seem to be formed by nature, if such a thing exists, as well as by all the signs of a Divine vocation, to the priesthood. His mildness and modesty, the two leading characteristics of the priesthood, are conspicuous. His labors are arduous and almost incessant, but he is rewarded by seeing the abundant fruits of them in the conversion of sinners, the building of churches, and the institution of seminaries of learning.</p>
        <p>His charity and benevolence are on a par with his piety and zeal, and, being endowed with prudence and good judgment, it is no wonder that his administration of his parishes is satisfactory to his people.</p>
        <p>REV. FATHER LYNCH, pastor at present of Eureka, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 441" />Humboldt County, is, we understand, a Meath man. He got his education in the missionary college of All Hallows, and has been incessantly engaged on the mission in the diocese of Grass Valley since his ordination. Father Lynch is a gentleman of great dignity of manners, as well as a clergyman of solid piety and great prudence. He has been for several years stationed at Downieville, and had to attend a wide field of missionary duty at the base and on the sides of the Sierras. He bears in his physiognomy and manly form the strongly-marked characteristics of the Lynches who are of the oldest in Ireland. The Lynches of Galway were celebrated before the Christian Era, and from Connaught they spread into Meath and various parts of Leinster.</p>
        <p>REV. L. TORMEY, pastor of Carson, Nevada, is a native of Ireland, County Meath, and was educated in the College of All Hallows, near Dublin. Father Tormey is a most successful missionary priest, and endowed in a high degree with those qualifications and virtues which have distinguished the family name for several centuries. We read of a bishop of that name, O'Tormaigh of "Gilla-Isa-Mac-an-Skealy," that is, Ardagh, in 1237. There are several highly respectable families of this name known to the author in Wisconsin, as Tomah, as 
        <pb n="442 The Irish Race in California." />well as in Contra Costa County in this State, where Thomas and Patrick Tormey have been settled for years on extensive tracts of land known as the "San Joaquin Ranch." The Tormeys have been remarkable for prudence, honesty and integrity, as well as piety, for centuries, and all their characteristic virtues are happily blended and exemplified in the prudent pastor of Carson.</p>
        <p>REV. T. I. PETTIT, pastor of Truckee, is a native of Wexford, where the family name has been numerous for centuries. They were originally seated near Mullingar with the Dorcys and Daltons, and were at war with the O'Kellys of Monylea, whom they frequently subdued. They finally settled in Wexford, and became vigorous opponents of English oppression and shed their blood on many a battlefield in defense of their native land. Father Tom Pettit is of this brave old stock, and physically, as well as intellectually, he creditably represents the family. Father Pettit is a young gentleman of first-class mental powers, and accomplished scholarship. He is, besides, blessed by a constitution which no amount of physical labor can impair. While for hospitality, generosity, and other noble traits of character, he is almost without an equal on this coast.</p>
        <p>REV. DANIEL O'SULLIVAN, of Smartsville, Yuba 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 443" />County, is a native of Tralee, in Kerry, and received his education and ordination in Ireland, He is a gentleman of fine parts, and highly accomplished as a theologian, especially in that department of the sacred science which treats of Rubricks, or ceremonials. No small distinction for a young man.</p>

        <p>OUR CLERGYMEN (CONTINUED). THEIR NAMES, RESIDENCES,AND WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED.</p>
        <p>REV. WILLIAM MOLONY, of Colfax, Placer Co., is a gentleman whose talents could not fail to command respect in any community. He is a native of Listowel, County of Kerry, where his ancestors have resided since the sixteenth century, though the family was originally from Clare, where the tribe has many representatives, especially in the Molonys of Dooris and Kiltannon.</p>
        <p>There was a Bishop, a Dr. Molony, who, in 1689, wrote to Bishop Tyrril, of Clogher, to use his influence with King James II. and Cardinal 
        <pb n="444 The Irish Race in California." />Howard to have one Father O'Lyne appointed Bishop of Waterford. O'Lyne was appointed Vicar Apostolic only of Aghadoe.</p>
        <p>This Bishop Molony must have been a Papal Legate or, at least, a representative of the Irish Church, for we find him, not only recommending candidates for the mitre, but even opposing the appointment of others, such as Father Pierce, who was chaplain in King James's army. In all Munster and Connaught there were only four bishops at this date, 1689--two in each province. Dr. Molony remained on the Continent, most likely because his loyalty was suspected, and he dared not return to his native land.</p>
        <p>The subject of this brief and imperfect notice was born September 10th, 1842. Father Molony's maternal ancestors were Enrights. He combines the hereditary virtues of both branches of his family in his person. He is physically one of the most active young men living, and a most indefatigable laborer in his sacred calling, whenever and wherever duty summons him to their discharge. His oratorical powers are more than ordinary, and his style and language in his sermons and lectures indicate ripe scholarship and deep study.</p>
        <p>His zeal and unselfishness are conspicuous to 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 445" />all, and on this account, as well as on account of his charity and liberality, he is, and cannot fail always to be, idolized by his congregations. The rev. gentleman would not, we are sure, thank us if we said anything of his hospitality and generosity. Let it suffice to remark, that in those virtues few men equal and fewer still excel the honest and independent Father William Molony.</p>
        <p>REV. C. O'CONNOR, late secretary to the Archbishop and now of St. Peter's Church, is a native of Kerry, and an accomplished and pious young priest. He was most faithful and exact while secretary to the Most Rev. Archbishop, and now that he is charged with the care of souls, he is found equally efficient and popular. Though a gentleman of a high order of talent, he is humble and unpresuming--virtues that are very pleasing in a clergyman.</p>
        <p>VERY REV. THOMAS GIBNEY, pastor of Saint Peter's, is of an old Irish stock, the O'Geibennaigh's of Lienster [sic]. Very Rev. Father Gibney was educated in the missionary college of Drumcondra, and is a very popular clergyman, both among his parishioners and his fellow citizens. His pulpit oratory is very impressive, to which his dignity of manner and earnestness contribute not a little. He is noted for his hospitality and charity, and 
        <pb n="446 The Irish Race in California." />whatever income he receives from his people, is expended in the founding of his parochial school, and other works for the improvement of his parishioners.</p>
        <p>REV. FATHER HARRINGTON, a native of Cork, is is [sic] pastor of St. Francis Church. This reverend gentleman's name, though of English termination in its spelling, is nevertheless of a very old family, the O'h. Arractains, of the Irish annalists. Father Harrington is an accomplished scholar, and a most zealous clergyman. His congregation is a mixed one, being partly Spanish and partly Irish-American, and both nationalities are equally well pleased with his administration. He has two assistants, a Spanish priest, and theREV. FATHER CARRAGHER, a young gentleman of fine talents, and cultivated intellect. The Carraghers--Hibernice, "Ua Cairraighe"--were distinguished for their ecclesiastical spirit, in the County of Donegal, where their hereditary estates were. Our young reverend friend is of a studious turn of mind, and devotes to reading whatever leisure time he can spare from his more important duties of meditation and the instruction of his people in their religious duties.</p>
        <p>REV. HUGH P. GALLAGHER, the distinguished pastor of St. Joseph's, has his biography given in 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 447" />that book, by "Shuck," entitled, "The Representative Men of the Pacific Coast," to which the reader is referred, and from which the author declines to make extracts, to avoid the suspicion of plagiarism.</p>
        <p>The reader's attention is also directed to the life of a Bishop of Raphoe, of the same name, elevated to that See in 1420, by Pope Martin the V., which serves to illustrate the prominent positions of the O'Galcholers, in the Irish Church of former ages.</p>
        <p>REV. EDMUND MORRISSY, late of St. Patrick's Church, is a native of County Waterford, Ireland. The O'Morrissys, the "O'Murghesa" of ancient annals, were of princely origin. Nial O'Morrissy, who was Erenenagh of Hymanny, died in 1516, as recorded by the "Four Masters," and elsewhere the family can be traced back to the pre-Christian period in Irish history. So that those unread journalists who ridiculed, for instance, the famous and Hon. John Morrissy of New York as of plebeian origin, are greatly mistaken. The O'Morrissys were known and distinguished in the annals of "Innisfallen" centuries before any of the English modern nobility received their diplomas of aristocratic rank. Father Morrissy received his education at home in his native country, which is and has been well provided with schools, and colleges 
        <pb n="448 The Irish Race in California." />since the period of the relaxation of the "Penal Laws" against Irish education. Waterford, the ancient "Purt-Laerge," was famed in olden time as the seat of learning and sanctity. The world-famed schools of Lismore were in Waterford, founded by "St. Mochuda,'[sic] or Carthagh, in 633. This celebrated university long since disappeared beneath the torches of the plundering Scandinavians and merciless Saxons, but Mount Milleray, of the Carthusians, promises to become in time as famous as Lismore. Here, we understand, Father Morrissy learned his classics, and laid the foundation of that solid, but unobtrusive piety, which has distinguished him from his childhood. There is not a county in Ireland that can boast of a body of clergy, more zealous, pious, and spotless in their lives, as those of Waterford, and as a consequence, the laity are well instructed, and most exemplary in their lives.</p>
        <p>Waterford from an early day had a college, St. John's, where most of the clergy were educated; and several distinguished bishops in foreign lands, such as Walsh and Connolly, of Halifax, Fleming and Power, of Newfoundland, and Smyth, of Dubuque, were educated in Waterford.</p>
        <p>Father Morrissy is not unworthy of these and several others of his distinguished countrymen.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 449" />He is a man of fine talent, and gives promise of becoming a first-class preacher. He is highly esteemed by his parishioners, notwithstanding the vigor with which he denounces the vices to which a few of them may be addicted.</p>
        <p>Father Morrissy has a commanding appearance, and a grave, though pleasing, countenance; but beneath the solemn gravity of the priest lie concealed the quaint humor of the genuine Irishman and the polished wit of a well-cultivated intellect.</p>
        <p>REV. TIMOTHY FITZPATRICK, pastor of South San Francisco and chaplain to St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, was born in Roscarberry, in the County of Cork, and received his education in his native land. His family is of a most respectable origin, and he shows his nobility of descent in his manners and genuine good nature and sincerity of character. His nobility of origin is as evident from his countenance as his piety is conspicuous from his actions and minstrations [sic] in the discharge of his sacred duties. Father Fitzpatrick is most popular and beloved because he is good. In him the fine Irish gentleman and the dignified clergyman blend most harmoniously.</p>
        <p>REV. A. O'DONNELL, is a native of Tipperary, and was educated in the celebrated school of the Monks at Mount Milleray, near Cappaquin, in 
        <pb n="450 The Irish Race in California." />Waterford. The O'Donnells were of the oldest and most illustrious of Irish families. Their genealogy goes back to pre-Christian ages, and, since the sixteenth century, rose to the highest ranks as generals and statesmen, in the services of Austria, Spain, and France.</p>
        <p>The O'Donnells are found in all parts of Ireland, but were of "Cinel-Connel," and held their fortresses in Donegal. The name was originally written "O'Dumhnail," and were descended of Nial, of the "nine hostages," king of Ireland in the fifth century.</p>
        <p>The genealogy is briefly thus: "Dumhual, son of Dalagh, 868, A. D., who was son of Murcheactagh, or Murty, son of Ceanfada, son of Garbh, son of Ronan, son of Fergus, of Gulban, and lastly of Nial. They fought against the English to the last in Tyrconnell, of which they were sovereigns, until finally the Earl of Tryconnell [sic] fled to the continent and thus gave up the last stronghold of Irish independence. The O'Donnells were the bravest men that advanced the annals of Irish military renown.</p>
        <p>Father O'Donnell has, without doubt, the blood of the genuine O'Donnells in his veins, for he is, of his size and weight, we believe, the most active and powerful man on this continent. He has really 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 451" />an iron constitution, the vigor of which has been severely tested by the arduous labors of the reverend gentleman, by the discharge of his duties in visiting the sick, and giving missions to the scattered congregations over whom he has charge, in Trukee [sic], the Sierra Valley, the parching plains of Colusa, and other and more difficult places. He has often been obliged to swim rivers, to wade to his neck through inundated valleys, and to scale pathless mountains, in order to give the consolations of religion to some negligent Christian.</p>
        <p>REV. FATHERS HYNES, CLARK AND COLEMAN also belong to the diocese of Grass Valley, and are highly esteemed by their congregations. The first named reverend gentleman for many years was pastor of Eureka, Nevada, where he effected great good among the miners of that town and its dependencies. Father Clark was pastor of Gold Hill, in Nevada, and highly esteemed, also, while Father Coleman was stationed in Virginia City. Where those reverend gentleman are now stationed is unknown to the author, not having received any answer to the communication addressed to them in reference to this work.</p>
        <p>REV. PATRICK POWER, pastor of Sutter Creek, but late of this city, is a fine specimen of an Irish 
        <pb n="452 The Irish Race in California." />gentleman, and a genuine Irish priest. He is a native of Waterford, the native country of the Powers for centuries, and got his education in Carlow College, a celebrated institution of learning, where the illustrious Dr. Doyle once presided, and where Dr. Cahill, too, graduated. Father Power, besides his high, manly bearing as a gentleman, is also a fine theologian, and an orator of no common parts. He is a rigid disciplinarian, and a vigilant and energetic rebuker of vice, in those committed to his charge.</p>
        <p>REV. FATHER NUGENT, of St. Patrick's, is also an Irishman, and is deservedly esteemed for his mildness and priestly virtues. To his lot falls much of the outside door work of the large parish of St. Patrick's. He is also a very pleasing preacher and devoted to the instruction of youth. He has a brother too, a clergyman at San Leandro, distinguished with virtues of the same kind as his reverence at St. Patrick's. They are natives of Leinster, for the Nugents originally belonged to the English Pale.</p>
        <p>REV. THOMAS McSWEENY, of the Cathedral of St. Mary's, is a native of Tramore, Waterford, the old country of the Diesi, where the McSweenys had held sway for many centuries. Father McSweeny is a young man of fine genius and elegant 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 453" />accomplishments. He promises to be a first-class pulpit orator, having a penetrating, clear voice, fine action and moving delivery; besides, he is a splendid chanter of the Mass and of church music. Father McSweeny, we understand, was educated at Carlow, which is a favorite institution with those whose means are liberal and abundant, such as Father McSweeny's family were. A bright career, no doubt, awaits this young clergyman in the country of his choice and adoption.</p>
        <p>To this imperfect list of the Catholic clergy of our race, we would willingly add the names of our countrymen of the Protestant ministry, only for the fact that we could learn so little of the latter on account of difficulty in finding their residences, which are seldom or never adjoining their meeting houses.</p>
        <p>The REV. DR. GUARD, a Methodist clergyman, is a native of Galway and a very eloquent orator. He is a gentleman of fine appearance, and would command respect in any religious body from his manners, his very dignified bearing and impressive discourses.</p>
        <p>Doctor Guard was for a time at the Cape Colony, in Africa, and in various other foreign countries. He gained great eclat and applause for his able defense of the Bible and Revelation 
        <pb n="454 The Irish Race in California." />against the blasphemous lectures of Colonel Ingersoll.</p>
        <p>REV. MR. McPHEETERS, another Methodist clergyman, a resident of Marysville, is also an Irishman, and an enthusiastic lover of his race and country. He is very much esteemed, even by the Catholics, and is entirely above that vulgur [sic] bigotry which in too many instances deforms many otherwise able men of his sect. Mr. McPheeters is a well educated and talented gentleman, and enjoys a wide popularity even outside his own congregation.</p>
        <p>There is Rev. Mr. Coyle, also a Methodist clergyman, Mr. McCarthy, pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church, and Mr. McCarthy, of Baptist Church; McElroy, Hemphill and several others already known to fame from their teachings.</p>

        <p>OUR JOURNALISTS, EDITORS, AND LITERARY MEN OF THEIRISH RACE. ROACH, O'MEARA, JESSUP, FISHER, O'CON-NEL, MAHONY, TIMMINS, CREIGHTON, McCLATCHY Mc-CARTHY, BALLINGER, COSGRAVE, McROBERTS, FLYNN,HIGGINS, O'SULLIVAN, O'LEARY, O'BRIEN, McRETT,TWOHY, ETC., ETC.</p>
        <p>HON. PHILIP A. ROACH, of whom we have written a brief notice in a former chapter, must have his name ranked also among our journalists. He is editor-in-chief and one of the proprietors of the San Francisco daily and weekly Examiner, a paper that stands in the first class among newspapers on this coast.</p>
        <p>JAMES O'MEARA, ESQ., was born in New York City, on the 22d of June, 1825. His parents emigrated from Cork, Ireland, at an early age, and gave their son James the best education that the country afforded, in order to prepare him for one of the learned professions. The young gentleman having had a taste for literature from his boyhood, instead of preparing himself for the bar, the pulpit or dissecting room, took to the press as his choice. He became contributor to the New York journals 
        <pb n="456 The Irish Race in California." />when quite young, and, since 1843, has been permanently connected with newspapers and journalism. Mr. O'Meara came to California in September 1849, and continued in connection with the daily and weekly press for about eight years, when he went, in 1857, to Oregon, and remained for nine years at the same business of journalism. In 1866, he settled in Idaho, where he established a leading newspaper, which he conducted as the sole editor and proprietor for three years, after which, in 1869, he returned again to Oregon, where he continued for seven years more in the same occupation. Finally he came to San Francisco in 1876, where he has been editorially employed at the daily Examiner and the Argonaut, a weekly family journal.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Meara may be called a veteran journalist, having been engaged over thirty-five years at the profession, without changing his mind or occupation. We do not know, nor do we care to enquire to what party in politics he belongs. Literature, taste and genius are above the influence of party, or should be so, and from Mr. O'Meara's style of writing, and the elegance and facility with which he writes, we are sure that he deserves high rank in the journalistic profession. His sketches and editorials in the Argonaut and the Examiner are 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 457" />models in their way of graphic description, and easy, elegant composition. The O'Mearas were a tribe among the Diesi in Meath, not far from Tara, called, to-day, Barony of Deece, the chiefs of whom were the O'Fealans and O'Brees. The locality of the O'Mores was called Hyfaha, now Offa Barony, in said county. There were other branches in Desmond and Thomond of the same stock, and all remarkable for the number of literary men they produced.</p>
        <p>GEORGE H. JESSUP, a poet and literateur of great celebrity, is an Irishman, born in Dury Hall, Longford, the home of his ancestors. He is a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, where he entered as a law-student; but, impatient of the quaint restraints of tedious law studies, he adopted literature as his profession, and contributed, even before he left college, articles of ability to the London magazines of the day. He came to California in 1872, and wrote for the Overland Monthly, and also edited a newspaper called the National. At this time, also, the Overland was edited by Walter M. Fisher, who succeeded Bret Harte as editor. Fisher is now in London, and a few months ago he published "The Californians," giving his impressions of the state of society here; as he handled the subject "without gloves," the book was severely criticized 
        <pb n="458 The Irish Race in California." />by the press of this State. Fisher is a graduate of the Queen's College, Belfast, and as a literary man occupies a first place.</p>
        <p>These two men, Jessup and Fisher, would not be considered as Irishmen from the circumstance that they are descended of Norman or German blood, but though not authorized to use the" Mac" or "O" before their names, they are Irish and are, proud of the land of their nativity. They inherit all the aspirations and genius of Irishmen, and we enrol them among the number of our distinguished countrymen, worthy of having their names inscribed on the national roll of honor of Ireland.</p>
        <p>DANIEL O'CONNELL is connected with the editorial staff of the Mail, a Democratic and well-edited journal of San Francisco. Mr. O'Connell was born in the County of Clare, Ireland, and is the son of a celebrated lawyer, Charles O'Connell, Esq., who for forty years was the leading man among his profession in Clare, that birthplace of so many learned men. "Charley O'Connell," as Daniel O'Connell's father was commonly called, was gifted with wonderful forensic powers. He was, in his own sphere, as gifted as his relative, the Liberator, was in all Ireland. His income must have been immense, for to retain Charley O'Con- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 459" />nell was equivalent to gaining one's cause in Clare and in Munster.</p>
        <p>His son, Master Daniel, no doubt, inherits a large share of the ability, if not all the astuteness and legal acumen, of his father. There appear, from day to day, certain articles in the Mail which, if written by Daniel, prove him to be as accomplished and classical a writer as his father was a successful lawyer.</p>
        <p>JOHN TIMMINS, ESQ., editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, is a native of Boston, but of Irish parentage. Having been brought up and educated in the modern Athens, it is no wonder that he has all the tact and sagacity of the New Englanders. He certainly is a very able writer and endowed with uncommon judgment, if we can judge him from his editorials in the Chronicle, one of the leading journals on the coast.</p>
        <p>Some people there are who may criticise the Chronicle harshly, accusing its proprietors of being purchasable and changeable in their policy; but it remains to be proved whether the journals which charge the Chronicle with inconsistency and venality are not themselves liable to like accusations. There is one thing certain, that the editorials and articles of the Chronicle are as well, if not better, written than those of any of the other daily 
        <pb n="460 The Irish Race in California." />papers; and this we attribute to the fact that Mr. Timmins occupies the chief editorial chair.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Timmins, who has occupied his position for a number of years, Messrs. O'Brien and Ballinger, both Irishmen, occupy the positions of editors of certain departments in the daily Chronicle, and do credit to their profession by their brilliant talents and elegant composition. There are several of the printers, such as Mr. Cuddy and others, employed on the Chronicle, and they all are pleased with the liberality and business integrity of the proprietors of the paper.</p>
        <p>There can be but one opinion of the course which the Chronicle lately pursued in exposing and denouncing the frauds of men in high official positions. All who are not blinded by prejudice or silenced by gifts allow that the Chronicle acted a brave part and deserved well of the people.</p>
        <p>The Chronicle may lose the patronage of the rich by exposing the vices of an upstart aristocracy, which would reduce the laboring class to the level with Chinese coolies. But it is from the dimes of the poorer classes, and not from the millions of the rich, that an independent journal should expect the most lasting patronage. The Chronicle has now a favorable opportunity to become the organ of the people, without distinction of class 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 461" />or position, and to enable it to do so the engagement of so many of our race on its editorial staff favorable to that end. Another of our talented countrymen, trained on the editorial corps of the Chronicle--Mr. McCarthy--is now, we understand, editor and proprietor of the Virginia City Enterprise. The celebrated European correspondent of the Chronicle--Stoddart----whose graphic descriptions astonished all, is an Irishman by birth or descent.</p>
        <p>CORNELIUS A. MAHONY was born in Dublin in 1848, that year which witnessed so many able men in Ireland. Mr. Mahony's life has been one of singular vicissitude and we might say of adventure. He has been by turns, a sailor, a soldier, a civil engineer and a newspaper correspondent on different parts of the globe. After a campaign or two during the Rebellion, and completing the tour of the world, if not in eighty days, at least in a comparatively short time, Mr. Mahony settled down as engineer in Callao, Peru, in the year 1873. He then got a contract for erecting, and did erect, one of the largest smelting works in that Republic, on the Island of San Lorenzo. Having finished the contract with the Peruvian Government, he came to San Francisco in a year or two after and engaged in mining for several months; but, as 
        <pb n="462 The Irish Race in California." />nothing had such an attraction for his versatile genius as literature, he returned again to the occupation most congenial to his cultivated mind, and hence we find him as correspondent to the Call, the Chronicle, the Post, and other journals and magazines. Mr. Mahony is now on the editorial staff of the Evening Post, as a dramatic critic and special writer. His articles are "racy of the soil," of the land of his birth--the mother of poets, orators and statesmen. Mr. Mahony's father was a leading politician in Dublin in the year '48 and before that time. He was organizer of some of the revolutionary clubs, of one of which, the "Curran Club," he was president, on account of which he was imprisoned with Doherty and other Young Irelanders. After having escaped the clutches of the British Government he came to the United States, where he traveled for four years. The "O'Mahonys"--"O'Mathamma" were lords and chiefs of Carberry, County of Cork, as well as a Northern branch of them kings of Ulidia, in Ulster, for centuries. They are a good old stock, and our friend, the editor, is not unworthy of the race.</p>
        <p>ROBERT JAMES CREIGHTON, a native of Londonderry, was trained on the Irish and English press. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1860, to take charge of the Southern Cross, then a small bi- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 463" />weekly newspaper published in Auckland, the capital of that British colony. Within a twelvemonth he transformed it entirely, and founded the Daily Southern Cross, a newspaper which rapidly attained a large circulation and commanding influence in the colony and England. More especially during the long and exhausting war the Southern Cross was conspicuous among colonial newspapers for its news enterprise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Creighton founded the Weekly News, a journal which received encomiums from American and British newspapers, and which is widely circulated in both hemispheres. He was elected a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1865, and about the close of 1867 withdrew from the editorial control and general management of both newspapers. During a portion of this period Mr. Creighton was also a member of the Auckland Provincial Legislature, and as Provincial Secretary it was his good fortune to initiate and complete the most perfect system of roads and tramways, for the development of the Thames gold field, since so celebrated as a quartz mining territory, to be found anywhere in Australasia.</p>
        <p>As a member of the Colonial Legislature, Mr. Creighton took a prominent part in its debates and party management. He was always friendly to 
        <pb n="464 The Irish Race in California." />the Irish national cause, and was instrumental in preventing the enactment by the New Zealand Parliament of the "Treason Felony Bill," which several Australian Legislatures enacted during the Fenian scare, after the unhappy attempt upon the life of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1874, when the Liberal party of the province of Otago, in the south of New Zealand, desired to establish an organ, they secured Mr. Creighton's services, and he founded the Otago Guardian, a first-class daily newspaper, which at once attained a large circulation. He was then requested to take editorial charge of the New Zealand Times, at the new capital of the colony;[sic] Wellington, but having determined to come to this city, he severed his connection with journalism, and landed in San Francisco, in June, 1876, since when he has been employed as an editorial writer on the Evening Post.</p>
        <p>Connected with the Morning Call, one of the most popular newspapers of the city or coast, are M. P. Kelly, Esq., law reporter, Isaac Higgins, editor, and Mr. McRoberts, a very accomplished stenographer and reporter. The two former, we presume, are of Irish descent, but Mr. McRoberts is a native of Ireland, though of Scotch parentage.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 465" />The Morning Call, no doubt, owes no small share of its great popularity to the talent and tact of these gentlemen, as well as to the cultivation and genius of Mr. Cameron, a most distinguished writer as well as a perfect gentleman. Sorry he is not an Irishman, though he is the next best thing--a Scotchman. The Callis very generally read by our people and liked by them, and it is seldom, if ever, that it inserts anything hostile to our race, either in a national or religious point of view.</p>
        <p>The only fault which can be, with any plausibility or pretense, laid to its charge is, that it conceals its principles and is wanting in that independence with which it should ever denounce official dishonesty and "rings" of monopolists which paralyze industry and oppress the laboring class. But these charges are most likely groundless and exaggerated.</p>
        <p>MR. McCLATCHY, of the Sacramento Bee, is one of our cleverest and most enterprising journalists. He was born in Lisburn, County Antrim, in 1824, and came to America in '48. His biography in itself would make a most interesting volume. He was one of the passengers of the unlucky Dolphin, a vessel bound from Mazatlan to San Francisco, but which was lost on the Southern coast of California, in the year 1849. The passengers and 
        <pb n="466 The Irish Race in California." />crew of the abandoned craft at Ceros--68 in number--suffered intensely from want of provisions and water, after leaving the vessel. They landed on an unknown and barren coast, 400 miles from San Diego, and were reduced to the greatest extremity by hunger and thirst. They traveled miles and during days without finding even the faintest signs of water. They tried to suck moisture from the earth by applying their mouths to the parched mud over which water had evidently once flowed. At length they saw an old horse abandoned by some persons who traveled that way before them, and their spirits were cheered at the sight, thinking that there must be some inhabitants somewhere in the vicinity; but they were mistaken, and had to shoot the horse and eat its flesh in order to save their lives. They next saw a cross erected over a grave, a cheering sight too. A dog was the only animal who continued to share their distress, and that poor brute was about to be sacrified [sic] like the old horse, when, running into a deep ravine, he began to scrape the soil with his paws. Some of the party, noticing the dog's efforts, came up to him and found the earth moist where the dog was scratching with all his might. Digging a few feet deep in the little cavity, made by the faithful dog, they found a good supply 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 467" />of sweet cold water. Oh, what a treasure was in this discovery! If every drop in that spring had been a diamond, the discovery would not have been so valuable in the eyes of the famishing men whose lives were saved by that water.</p>
        <p>After satisfying themselves the party, among whom was Mr. McClatchy, went back with bottles and canteens of the refreshing beverage to those whom they were obliged to abandon on the way. They were barely alive, but, refreshed by the saving water, they soon rallied and recovered. Taking courage from this providential discovery, the entire party proceeded on their way. They lost not a single man out of forty-eight. It was several days, if not weeks, before they came within the confines of civilization, and then, barefooted and semi-nude, they proceeded until they reached the Mexican and American settlements.</p>
        <p>Editor McClatchy was among the bravest of that distressed party. The party after having reached the confines of civilization, continued their journey on foot. They were all barefooted, without shoe or stocking, and in this condition they traveled from Cerros, in Lower California, to San Jose, and even to the mines at the foothills. They lost their shoes the second day after having abandoned the boat, from the circumstance that, having washed 
        <pb n="468 The Irish Race in California." />the leather to get off the sand and adhesive mud, they placed them in the sun to dry, but in a few hours they were reduced to powder from its heat. Then they traveled all the way without shoes, and when they could procure shoes at San Jose, they found they could not wear them. They looked upon shoes and all other covering of the feet as a superfluous luxury! Being six months without shoes, they had come into the habit of regarding barefeet as far more pleasant than having their understandings enclosed within the hides of animals. Such is the force of habit and natural tendency of man to return to the semi-barbarous condition, contrary to the Darwinian theory.</p>
        <p>There are many other Irish-Americans editing and owning newspapers in the country towns, such as Judge Twohy, of the San Jose Herald and John Manning of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, but whose names we cannot put down to do honor to our pages, for the want of acquaintance with the gentlemen personally.</p>
        <p>MR. O'SULLIVAN, of the Monitor, is an able and elegant writer, and together with his partner, Mr. Lyons, makes their journal a very interesting and useful publication. The Monitor newspaper, the organ of the Catholics of the coast, is a journal of wide circulation and of first-class ability. The 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 469" />editor-in-chief is Richard O'Sullivan, Esq., B. A., who is a brother of the distinguished editor of the Dublin Nation, a poet, an orator, and a statesman of the highest order. There are several brothers of the O'Sullivans, all men of genius, whom even their political enemies acknowledge, as the ablest men of the day in English literature. A new book called "New Ireland," by Mr. O'Sullivan, M. P., has been so popular, even in England, that the several editions of the work were engaged, even before publication, so that a single copy could not be purchased save by those who anticipated its publication.</p>
        <p>DENNIS LYONS, ESQ., senior partner, is a gentleman of fine ability.</p>
        <p>MR. McRETT, the editor of the Wasp, is a gentleman of fine talent and sound sense, and a very popular and favorite writer, while O'Leary, of the Commercial Advertiser, is a veteran editor of great ability.</p>

        <p>PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF SAN FRANCISCO. DOCTORSBUCKLEY, KANE, AND MURPHY. MERCHANTS, PROFES-SIONAL AND BUSINESS MEN OF OUR RACE. ETC.</p>
        <p>San Francisco is provided with more than six hundred physicians and surgeons, regular and irregular, of all schools, allopathic, homeopathic, eclectic and hydropathic, male and female, Caucasian, and Mongolian, and African, to look after the physical health of her citizens. For every five hundred persons in the city there is one physician and a fraction, ready to respond to the call of the sick and the infirm, within the city and her borders. In order that this large corps of scientific practitioners should get support, at the lowest calculation they should receive one call to each inhabitant of the city, which, at three dollars a visit, would amount to about one million and a half annually; but it is well understood that our physicians' salaries, in the aggregate, amount to over $30,000,000.</p>
        <p>The number of clergymen of all sects, denominations and creeds, including Jewish preachers, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 471" />do not amount to more than one hundred, or one-sixth the number of "doctors," and allowing each of those the same salary of $5,000 each, which is far too high, we have to pay only five millions for the care of our souls against thirty which we pay for securing the health of our bodies. People, nowadays, therefore, take much more care of their bodies than of their souls.</p>
        <p>This much, however, is to be said in favor of the physicians of San Francisco, that there are among them men of first-class ability and qualifications.</p>
        <p>San Francisco can compare favorably with any city in the United States, in the high standing and scientific attainments of many of her surgeons, and the men of our race, as is the case in the British Empire, stand at the head of their profession. Out of the six hundred in the city, those of the Irish race count about eighty, and all of the regular or allopathic school. We cannot give the names of all our distinguished surgeons, graduates of the Royal College of Surgeons, of Ireland, but Dr. C. F. Buckley, 646 Market street, Dr. F. B. Kane, 620 Market street, are men of the highest grade in their profession, as also are Dr. James Murphy, 659 Clay street and Dr. H. Gibbons, Jr., 26 Montgomery street.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="472 The Irish Race in California." />DOCTOR BUCKLEY is a comparatively young man in years, about thirty-five, but his practice is extensive and his experience wide and practical, while as a scholar and well-read physician, he has few equals in the city, or in the United States.</p>
        <p>Dr. Buckley is a graduate of Queen's University Ireland, where he studied and graduated in medicine, but we understand also successfully prosecuted his classical and scientific education before he embraced the medical profession. He came to California in 1869, and, though he had not many acquaintances or friends to recommend him, yet in a few years he advanced himself to public notice by his successful treatment of some of the most critical cases in the medical records of this great city. The doctor is a man of liberal views and very independent in his manners, at the same time that he is au fait in all the accomplishments and dignified courtesy of an Irish gentleman. The Buckley family traces its pedigree back to an early date. The Irish way of spelling the name was "O'Buachalla." One of the name was abbot of Dromacose, barony of Keenaght, County of Londonderry, in the tenth century; but the territories of the "Clan Buchalla" were in the west part of the present County of Cork, facing the broad Atlantic. The name is well represented in 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 473" />many of the Eastern States, such as by John Buckley, Washington County, New York, a wealthy farmer. The Buckleys have been always faithful to creed and fatherland, a distinction which has not failed to accompany them on this side of the Atlantic, as well as on the other side of the ocean.</p>
        <p>DOCTOR KANE, of 620 Market street, is son of the distinguished Sir Robert Kane, President of the Queen's University, in the city of Cork. Sir Robert was knighted in acknowledgment of his literary and scientific attainments. He wrote a book entitled "The Industrial Resources of Ireland," which was published in or about the year 1840, which O'Connell declared to be the best work ever written on that subject in any age. The object of the work was to show the wonderful mineral and agricultural wealth that Ireland contained if her resources were only developed. This he proved chemically and practically, showing that Ireland contained within her four seas all that was necessary for the support of a population of over twenty millions of souls, if her productions were only developed to their full extent.</p>
        <p>Doctor Kane published, also, several other works which were used as class-books in the university and colleges of Ireland. His works were not only scientifically composed, but written in a style of 
        <pb n="474 The Irish Race in California." />singular purity and precision of language. Sir Robert, we believe, is a native of Kildare, but the territory of the O'Kanes, especially that branch of them to which Dr. Kane belongs, was in the County of Londonderry, and embraced the Baronies of Tirkeeran, Keenaght and Coleraine. Cooey O'Kane was a celebrated chieftain, and head of the "Oseiraght ui Cathain" tribe, and was made a prisoner by the English in the port of Coleraine, in 1377, and confined in fetters in the dungeon of Carrickfergus. This hero was one of the forefathers of Dr. Kane, of this city, and one of his brothers was christened Cooey in memory of the brave old chieftain and martyr.</p>
        <p>The celebrated Dr. Kane, of the Arctic expedition fame, was a scion of the old illustrious stock. In the history of his life, written by "the stranger's heedless hands," there is a line or so acknowledging that the explorer had Irish blood in his veins, but no attempt was made to follow up his pedigree, or to prove, if he was of enterprising genius and of invincible fortitude, that these characteristics were inherited by him from his ancestors in Ireland. Dr. Kane, of this city, came to this country more from a desire to enjoy the salubrity of the climate or from a love of travel than from any other motive. His coming away from his native country deprived 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 475" />him of many advantages from the fame of his father and the high social circle in which the family moved--advantages which he could never expect to enjoy in a foreign land. However, we imagine, the doctor has no cause to complain of the want of patronage of the people of San Francisco, for his practice is large and his merits as an accomplished surgeon are becoming daily better known. Whether he will ever return to live on the paternal estates, we know not, but suppose that, like many distinguished Irishmen, whose fathers owned lordly estates, he may prefer this atmosphere of liberty, though it appears occasionally somewhat "foggy," to all the pomp and pride of the English aristocratic associations.</p>
        <p>The late Dr. P. M. O'Brien was a distinguished member of the medical profession and a gentleman of high tone and principles. He was one of the first, we believe the very first, organizers of that solid institution, the Hibernia Bank. He was Medical Director at Port Townsend Hospital, under the government, at or about the time of the Rebellion, but, though, in the government employment, he gave publication to his adverse Democratic sentiments, and quitted his place rather than remain a silent observer of abuses.</p>
        <p>He returned from Port Townsend to California, 
        <pb n="476 The Irish Race in California." />and settled at San Jose, where he died, universally regretted. He was a native of Cork, from or near Mallow, and belonged to a family eminent for literature and religion. His daughter, one of the most beautiful and accomplished ladies of the State, became the wife of Senator Patrick W. Murphy, but, soon joining her father in Heaven, she left her husband and friends in utter bereavement at her loss. R. I. P.</p>
        <p>Dr. O'Brien's widow and family reside near the village of Santa Clara, and are in independent circumstances.</p>
        <p>There are many physicians of our race whose permission to have their names introduced in this work we have not obtained. Such are Drs. Jones, Callaghan, Blake, Flood, McCarthy, O'Neil, Rogers, Gibbons, Sullivan, etc., who have a large practice and are deservedly successful on account of their learning, skill and experience. Irish physicians and surgeons are generally well educated. The classical instructions in Greek and Latin, which all intended for this honorable profession, almost without exception, receive facilitates their knowledge of the terms and nomenclature of surgery, without the aids of medical diction and glossaries, which are always made use of in American medical schools; while the long courses of lectures and 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 477" />severe tests of the pupils in time of examination for graduation secures the public in Great Britain and Ireland against the "plague of quacks" which swarm in this country, owing to laws of ignorant legislatures. Hence, the State of California, having such a large number of Irish and European surgeons, is much better off in regard to surgeons than most of the Eastern States.</p>
        <p>The merchants and business men of the Irish race, as well as the capitalists, are both numerous and wealthy, and of high standing. A bare list of the names of the Irish-American merchants of San Francisco, not to mention Oakland or any of the interior cities, would fill a large volume.</p>
        <p>The firm of Murphy, Grant &amp; Co., wholesale dealers in dry goods, stands, probably, at the head of the business in the State. The house imports largely from the continent of Europe and Great Britain, as well as from the Eastern States.</p>
        <p>The firm of O'Brien &amp; Co., 928 Market street, near Baldwin's Hotel, is an extensive retail dry goods concern, and does an immense business. The proprietors are the most enterprising of this respectable class of trade in the city, and receive, because they deserve it, a very general patronage.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="478 The Irish Race in California." />Keane, O'Connor &amp; Co., of Kearny street, are extensive dry goods merchants, and are of high standing in the trade.</p>
        <p>McCain &amp; McClure, of Pine street, are wholesale dry goods merchants of very extensive business and high standing in the community.</p>
        <p>Kennedy &amp; Brennan, Third street, B. P. Kennedy, Kearny street, O'Neil, Kennedy &amp; Stuart, and Wynne, Louth &amp; Co., of 706 Market, each do a very large retail trade in their well-supplied stores.</p>
        <p>Our Irish-American apothecaries and druggists are well represented by McBoyle &amp; Co., 504 Washington street, McDonnell, corner Sixth and Market streets, and H. B. Slaven, Esq., an accomplished chemist and pharmaceutist, under the Baldwin Hotel, corner Market and Powell streets. Mr. Slaven does an immense business, which is continually increasing, from the security which the people have that in dealing in his store they will get the very best materials, and compounded and prepared in the most scientific manner.</p>
        <p>The attorneys of this city are somewhat more numerous than the physicians, being about 700, and of these, about one-fourth are of our own race. The Macs' and O's are well represented among the lawyers. There are four Murphys,&lt;illustration&gt;P. J. O'CONNOR, ESQ.&lt;/illustration&gt; 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 479" />Dan. J., John L., P. G., and one who spells his name Murfey. O'Brien, Thos., 712 Montgomery street, and O'Connor, Frank, represents the O's. Charles Delany, brother of the Bishop of Cork, is a leading lawyer of this city.</p>
        <p>The architects are represented by P. J. O'Connor, Esq., 5 Post, T. J. Welsh, and William Corcoran.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor, besides being first-class in his profession as architect, is a man of uncommon talent. He was born in Liverpool, and is of the ancient noble stock of the O'Connors of Ballinagare. He was educated in the most advanced schools of England and Ireland, and had an uncle a bishop, lately deceased, and a brother one of the most learned among the Irish clergy, who graduated with high honor in Rome, and is now parish priest of Rathkeale, in the County Limerick.</p>
        <p>The principal firms in the wholesale cattle and butchering trade are Dunphy &amp; Co., Donnelly &amp; Dunne, Kelly &amp; Dooly, O'Brien, Dean &amp; Smith, Regan &amp; O'Neil, Clancy &amp; Horgan, and the Crummys, while out of the four hundred retail butchers, perhaps the one-third are Irishmen. The principal among the latter are Hon. Thomas Mclnerny, of the firm of Mclnerny &amp; Co., of 311 Broadway 
        <pb n="480 The Irish Race in California." />and 52 Washington Market--a wealthy firm. I. W. Flyn, 903 Jones street, does a large retail business and deserves the patronage he receives, from his attention to his business and his well known respectability.</p>
        <p>In all the laborious employments our countrymen have almost a monopoly, for no other people are more willing or better able to work than the Irish. Hence, for instance, in the occupation of blacksmithing, Irish names are conspicuous; among these are P. J. O'Brien and his son, Willis--first-class men at their business--on Bryant street; O'Niel &amp; McClosky on Powell street, and about one hundred others, including Mr. N. Ennis of 1062 Howard street.</p>
        <p>In the book trade we are represented in the exclusively Catholic publications by Michael Flood of Market street, a gentleman of the highest reputation, with a very large business, and John B. O'Connor, 103 Sixth street. Mr. Shea keeps a large assortment of books and periodicals at 815 Market street, and Mrs. Ryan at No. 40 Fourth street, besides McCabe, Kearny street; Magill, Market; Geraghty, Folsom street; Kearney, Polk; Dwyer &amp; McArdle, Pacific Hotel, and Sweeny, Sansom[e] [sic]street.</p>
        <p>The Irish-American wholesale and retail boot 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 481" />and shoe merchants of San Francisco are a highly respectable class. The Nolan Brothers, of 514 Market street, do a business which falls little short of one million of dollars annually, and their business is increasing. And Hugh O'Connor, of 506 Market street, also does a very extensive business. These two firms employ none but white help in their shops, and hence their work is better done, and consequently ensures the confidence of the people. Those who employ Chinese workmen may be able to sell cheaper than the former, but their manafactures [sic] do not give satisfaction. Of the retail shoe establishments, which, number about six hundred, nearly one-half, or at least one-third, are those of our countrymen. Of these Broderick, of 112 Third, and P. Kelly, of Bush street, are fair representatives.</p>
        <p>Among our wholesale grocers are Cullinan &amp; Co., 307 Clay; Hanly &amp; Snow, McMullin &amp; Co., John Molloy, 54 Clay street, and Foley &amp; Jones, 219 Drumm street.</p>
        <p>There are about one hundred hotels in San Francisco, one-fourth of which are owned or rented by Irish-Americans, and are of all prices, from $5 a day to $1. One of the most reasonable and respectable of the low-fare houses is the Franklin, kept by Hugh Curran, Esq., a perfect 
        <pb n="482 The Irish Race in California." />gentleman, who tries and, indeed, succeeds in making his guests as comfortable in his one dollar a day house as they could be, even if they paid five dollars. The house is at the corner of Sansome and Pacific, and the rooms are large, lofty and lightsome.</p>
        <p>The Golden Eagle Hotel, on Broadway, run by Messrs. Barry &amp; Co., is another pleasant resort for immigrants.</p>
        <p>The wholesale and retail liquor dealers of San Francisco are at least two thousand in number; that is to say, there is one place where liquor is sold to each one hundred and fifty of the population, whereas there are less than one-half that number of provision and grocery stores! What a large revenue the city treasury must derive for the licensing of those two thousand places for the sale of liquors, and what an enormous cost to the people who patronize these concerns! Besides the rents, taxes, gas and water rates, and fixtures, these two thousand saloons and liquor places cost the incredible sum of $14,809,600, or very nearly fifteen millions annually. It is no wonder the majority of the people are poor when they expend about twenty millions annually for liquid poison in the shape of liquor. It is no wonder that the people are subject to sickness and sudden death, 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 483" />though this is the finest climate on earth! It is no wonder that funerals are magnificent and the doctors rich. Those two thousand saloons account for all the ways the money is spent.</p>
        <p>The cemeteries are pleasant, the monuments costly, the funerals grand, as well as solemn, and the undertakers are not all of them rich, but perhaps, like that honest man, James McGinn, Esq., they are too generous, and always charitable toward the poor. Mr. McGinn, Fitzgerald &amp; Co., of Mission street, and Mr. Golden of Market street, above Sixth, well represent this class of our countrymen, who discharge the last duties to the dead by decently consigning them to their last resting place on earth.</p>

        <p>LEADING PIONEER AND DISTINGUISHED CITIZENS OF OURRACE IN OAKLAND, SACRAMENTO, MARYSVILLE AND OTHERTOWNS. BRIEF NOTICES OF SUCCESSFUL IRISH MINERSAND REMARKABLE MODERN IRISHMEN. THE COUNTRYPREFERABLE TO THE CITY FOR OUR PEOPLE.</p>
        <p>The next city to San Francisco in population is Oakland, across the bay, and which was incorporated as a town in 1852. Oakland, at present contains a population of at least 40,000, but at its incorporation it had not more than one hundred people, whereas the population of Sacramento at this time was 12,000. Oakland, though only about eight miles distant from San Francisco, over the bay, has a far milder climate than the former.[sic] being almost altogether exempt from the sudden changes of temperature and dusty gusts of wind which, in certain seasons, infest the latter city. Hence, Oakland is a famous resort for invalids, and a great many of the wealthy business men of San Francisco have their residences there. Oakland is destined to be a very large city, possibly its population will exceed that of San Francisco in the course of time.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 485" />Our Irish race are well represented in Oakland, and some of them were the first pioneers of that corporation and of Alameda County.</p>
        <p>William Welsh, in 1848, received three square leagues of land, called "Los Juntas," from Governor Micheltorena. Mr. Welsh, no doubt, must have performed some popular or praiseworthy act, or been a man of more than ordinary character, to have deserved such a mark of public favor, as the receiving of such a large grant of land from the Government.</p>
        <p>Don Luis Peralta was owner of the ranch "San Antonio," on part of which Oakland is now located. This grant Peralta received from Sola, the last Spanish Governor of California, in consideration of forty years' of military and civil service. The land contained five leagues, including, besides Oakland, then called "Encinal de Temescal," Brooklyn, Alameda, Berkeley and San Leandro. Only two of these divisions retain their original flames, viz.: Alameda and San Leandro. What a pity Oakland did not chance to get a more urbane name, or one which would give the intelligent immigrant an idea that the place was a city or village, instead of a tract of land covered with oak trees!</p>
        <p>The usual inferior taste and poverty of inven- 
        <pb n="486 The Irish Race in California." />tion of our countrymen of Anglo-Saxon origin, are exemplified in naming this charming city, which, like Venus, seems as if it rose like a sunlit cloud from the froth of the sea.</p>
        <p>There are numerous other names of places, at least one hundred and fifty in number, more ridiculous than that of Oakland, such as "Puppy Town," "Petticoat Slide," "Rag Town," "Bluebelly Slide," "Puke Ravine," "Gospel Swamp," "Loafer's Retreat," "Hungry Camp," "Pokerville" and "Fiddletown" (some of which names are incorporated in legislative literature), but though these names are perchance low and vulgar, there is not one of them more inappropriate than Oakland.</p>
        <p>Before the discovery of gold, Welsh, an Irishman, Livermore, an Englishman, and Dr. Marsh, an American, were the principal settlers of foreign birth, but the names, Smith, Brown and Farrelly, Kennedys, Crane, Murrays, Patten, McMurtys, Haleys, Broders, Moores, Dohertys, Allen, O'Brien, soon afterwards became conspicuous. Mr. Crane was County Judge, and Michael Murray's name was given to a township of the county, and Dublin was also raised into the like honor. John Boyle had the first blacksmith shop in San Lorenzo, in 1853.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 487" />J. W. Doherty, Esq., was chairman of the first Board of Supervisors of Oakland, and Mr. Blake, District Attorney. Then there were Eagar, Fay, Murry and Lucas, in '55. Soon after, McKee, Dr. Gibbons and Mr. Ward appear in public. In 1858 we find the names of Irish-Americans becoming more prominent, such as Curry, Molony, Redmund, Fallon, Hester, Rodgers, McKee, Gibbons, all candidates for, or elected to important offices in Alameda County, while among the rich men or capitalists, are Carey, Patterson, Hughes, Coffee, Maddox, Cull, Luce, Donnovan and others.</p>
        <p>We find in 1867 among the names of those who received patents for land from the United States, those of Martin, Brophy, Williams, Walker, Stephens, Larkin, A. Carey, Michael Gannon, Patrick Clark, Wm. J. Reid, Henry Hagan, Wm. Corbet, Michael H. Ryan, Mr. Lynch, Haley, A. McClure and other names of Irish origin or birth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch was Superintendent of Public Schools in Alameda County for several terms, and Mr. Gagan was proprietor of an Oakland daily paper. He was an able man, a native of Galway, and came from Illinois. He published the first daily newspaper of Oakland. A Mr. Powers is editor of the daily Transcript, an enterprising newspaper. The towns of Dublin and Limerick, laid out at an early day, 
        <pb n="488 The Irish Race in California." />prove that the Irish were early settlers. Thomas Eagan was the first man to explore Alameda County and its borders, which he did in 1846.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a fair proportion of the farming lands of the County belongs to men of our race. Such are Peter Matthews, Peter and James McGee, H. Mahoney, Mr. Higgins, Mr. Hart, F. J. Brearty, J. A. O'Niel, Mr. O'Brien--who discovered coal in 1860--John Matthews, Mr. Devanny, John Green, and Mr. Farrelly; Mr. Quigley, near San Leandro, and Mr. O'Sullivan, of Brooklyn. While that distinguished jurist, Judge McKee, and J. Ross Brown, the two ablest men that Oakland can boast of, were of Irish birth.</p>
        <p>John B. Doyle, of San Pablo avenue, is a Carlow man, from the parish of Graig. Mr. Doyle came to America when he was only ten years. He has resided twenty-two years in California. He owns 200 acres of land in Alameda County, twenty-four of which is on San Pablo avenue. Mr. Doyle is a branch of that family which produced the celebrated Dr. Doyle. J. J. O'Shea, hardware merchant, John and Thomas Lynch, Esq., capitalists, and Dr. Lawlor and brother, of Tubbs' Hotel, are leading citizens of Oakland. The celebrated author and traveler, J. Ross Brown, and Samuel B. McKee, who were residents of Oak- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 489" />land, were both of Irish birth. J. J. White is a leading man of our race in Oakland. He is a native of Cahir, Tipperrary, where his father was remarkable for the oppostion [sic] he offered, as a leading merchant, to Lord Glengall, in favor of Shiel and the patriotic candidates. Mr. White came from Sydney to California in 1856, having spent twelve years in that Colony.</p>
        <p>SACRAMENTO, the capital of the State, is one of the most interesting cities of California. Its foundation dates no further back than the discovery of gold in 1848, at Coloma, Placer County, where Sutter had a mill at that early date. Sacramento is well situated for trade, having communication by water and railroads with San Francisco and all parts of the State. The State Capitol, a splendid edifice, has been erected there at a cost of less than two million dollars. Though subject to occasional inundations, and situated in a low, flat, malarious country, the town is comparatively healthy. It is 125 miles by water from San Francisco, but only 84 miles by rail and boat via Vallejo. Many of the pioneers of this now elegant city were Irishmen, and there is a large body of our countrymen, both opulent and respectable, who are residents there at present.</p>
        <p>Among others, the Secretary of State Beck, 
        <pb n="490 The Irish Race in California." />Brigadier-General Walsh, Casey and Cronin, Dan'l J. Considine, the proprietor of the popular Pacific Hotel; H. Duffy, W. Mahony, Thos. P. Ryan, M. J. McCarthy, Mr. Fitzgibbons, Thos. Kane, P. H. Breen and others. In all the cities and villages of the State our countrymen are respectably, if not numerously, represented.</p>
        <p>In Marysville, Yuba County, "the Irish element" is conspicuous for the respectability of its members. Among others, we may particularize Richard Walsh, merchant, as one of the most polished gentlemen of the State, and regarded as a fine specimen of the Irish aristocracy. Mr. Walsh is a native of Cork, and acquired his education and polished manners in his native city. It would be hard to find a better Irishman or a more accomplished gentleman than Richard, Walsh, Esq.</p>
        <p>Michael Fitzgerald is another representative countryman of ours who is a credit to his race. He is a man of fine talent, and very popular in his county, in which he has filled several important positions of trust with fidelity.</p>
        <p>P. Slattery, Esq., is another successful Irishman doing a large business there, from which he derives a splendid income.</p>
        <p>In the small mining village of Cherokee Flats, in Butte County, is an Irish settlement, consisting 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 491" />of a few families, of some of whom we give an account here in order that our Eastern readers may form an idea of the manner in which the old settlers have succeeded in acquiring independence in past times.</p>
        <p>First we shall notice Mr. John Welsh, or Walsh, who is a native of Connaught, probably Galway. He commenced working as a laborer some dozen or fifteen years ago, at three or four dollars a day. From the savings of his daily wages he soon purchased some ruining claims, which turned out to be rich. Though a man of limited school education, he has a good, sound judgment, and what he purchased for a few hundred dollars brings him in probably an income of $1,000 a month! Mr. Welsh is a fine specimen of an Irishman, healthy, large and well built, and has a tenacious memory and good, sound common sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. John Whelan is another successful Irishman, a native of Tipperary, and a resident of Cherokee for over twenty-two years. He was not ashamed to work, and often made, at "washing dirt," $15.00 to the pan, especially in the famed Union Cape Mine, on Feather River, near Oroville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Everett, a Kilkenny man, is another honest and successful miner, also independent. So also 
        <pb n="492 The Irish Race in California." />is Mr. William Ryan, another Tipperary man. Mr. John Twohy, a Clare man, probably not far from Tulla, is another successful workman. He now oversees, at a fine salary, the Spring Valley Company's mines.</p>
        <p>Mr[.] [sic] Matthew Ryan keeps a smithy, and works for the mining companies, and has accumulated a handsome property.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brosnan, a Limerick man, must not be forgotten. Nor Mr. Doyle, an Antrim man, of fine appearance and fair education.</p>
        <p>Mr. James Lynch, is a Limerick man, who raises grapes and makes a very superior quality of wine, with which he supplies the clergy of a large portion of the diocese of Marysville.</p>
        <p>Mr. John Chambers is a successful miner and owns "claims," as they are called. Adding to this list the name of Mr. Bligh, we give a fair number of the successful, religious, liberal, and really good Irishmen of Cherokee Flats, which is the most united, happy and comfortable community, we think, in all California, as far as our experience goes. They have a handsome church, the only one in town, with a splendid bell in its tower, which flings its music reverberating over the hills and rocks, and golden gulches of Cherokee Valley, once so smooth, quiet and calm, but now 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 493" />disturbed, disquieted, and deformed by all the ingenious contrivances of grasping, greedy, gold-seeking corporations. We conclude with this notice of Cherokee Flats, by a brief sketch of another settler there, namedNicholas Willoughby, lieutenant in the 69th regiment, New York State Militia, from 1854 to 1858. Left New York, in October 1858, and arrived in California, June 22d, 1859. Went to Frazer River gold mines, and was in the party that discovered the John Day mines, in north-eastern Oregon, and Boise Basin, Idaho. He was elected Justice of the Peace in 1875.</p>
        <p>Grass Valley, Nevada County, is another town which was originally almost exclusively settled by Irishmen. The famous "Allison Ranch," three miles from the County seat, was in the hands of Irish miners, and while the mines flourished the Irish of that district, under the direction of Father Dalton, erected a fine church and a splendid convent for the education of their children, and also an orphan house. As the mines decayed or gave out, most of our countrymen quitted the locality, but a few remained to give character and distinction to the Irish element. Among these, one Myles O'Connor, Esq., State Senator, a man of fine talent, and James K. Byrne, a lawyer of well 
        <pb n="494 The Irish Race in California." />known ability. Patrick English represents the mechanical arts in a worthy manner, and J. Judd, Martin Ford and J. J. Johnston represent the commercial interests. Peter Johnston is a leading business man, as is also Thomas Cloak, while Dennis Meagher, P. Murphy, Thomas Moran, and Michael Hynes are well-to-do business men of the town. Besides the inhabitants of the village, or rather city, of Grass Valley, there is a large number of Irish farmers in the surrounding country, who are not only in comfortable, but independent, circumstances. Grass Valley is an episcopal see, termed in church language, "Vallis pratensis,"--not a very literal translation--and is a pretty place, enbosomed among the surrounding hills, which fertilize its vine-clad gardens by their rivulets and enrich its sands by deposits of fine gold dust. The town is connected with the Central Pacific Railroad at Colfax, Placer County, by a narrow-gauge railroad, the fare on which, for a distance of sixteen and one-half miles, is a fraction less than two dollars, about as much as they charge by the Hudson River Railroad, from New York to Albany, a distance of one hundred and sixty miles! And for the same distance in Massachusetts, as from Grass Valley to Colfax, the fare is five cents.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 495" />In the Eastern part of Nevada County, the people generally are either Irish or of Irish descent.</p>
        <p>French Corral, Birchville, San Juan and Cherokee are all little mining camps up among the hills, the people of which are always employed and independent, because they have no masters.</p>
        <p>In French Corral are well-to-do miners, business men and ranchers, namely: George Ryan, J. Sullivan, Frank Coffey, D. Neville, Richard Skehan and Thomas Fitzsimons.</p>
        <p>In Birchville are Martin Morony, John O'Connor, P. Mara, J. Talbot, Wm. Flynn.</p>
        <p>In San Juan Thomas Phelan, Patrick Gaynor, F. Hagarty, and the Hogan brothers are the principal residents and, we may say, capitalists.</p>
        <p>Cherokee is a very prosperous locality, and, like its namesake in Butte County, the successful miners are all or very nearly all Irish. The Phelans, brothers of the Rev. Father Phelan, of Austin, Nevada, are among the most prosperous. The Brophy brothers, O'Connor brothers, Quigley brothers, are equally well to do; while H. Horagan, C. Cox, J. Casey, H. Callaghan, Michael Phelan, J. Driscoll, M. Meehan, M. Fitzpatrick, M. Bray, H. Hughes, Andrew Brennan and John McCarthy are all Irish and all independent.</p>
        <p>What we have written in this chapter concern- 
        <pb n="496 The Irish Race in California." />ing the condition of Irish settlers in the country villages and mining towns, will apply to a thousand different localities in this State, as well as the State of Nevada, where our countrymen have become, by honest industry, if not wealthy, at least comfortable and independent. It is too much the habit with many to travel around hunting for work, which they find difficult to procure; whereas, they should go to the country, and if they have not means to purchase or rent farms, they could easily get hold of a mining claim, which, when properly worked, would seldom fail to supply them with such a return as would be sufficient for their support, and perhaps ultimately be the means of elevating them to wealth, as instanced in the success of Mr. McGanny, of Smartsville, J. Walsh, of Cherokee Flats, and hundreds, besides, in a thousand different localities.</p>
        <p>The city is very pleasant to live in, and thousands of our people have become rich capitalists by taking up lots in the city, when property was cheap, but the country is better for our people to settle in. The chances of success are greater than in cities, where the majority will always remain poor and dependent, whereas, in the country, the majority are always successful.</p>
        <p>We have seldom known our countrymen to fail 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 497" />when they were in a position to conduct their own affairs, without the interposition of a boss or master, whereas such of them as lack enterprise to take hold of any business of their own, but are ever dependent on others for employment, are sure sooner or later to become reduced to straightened circumstances.</p>
        <p>It is good enough to seek employment at daily wages in an emergency, but the man who cannot secure permanent employment for himself and family, either by getting hold of a piece of land, or taking up a mining claim, or engaging in some commercial or mechanical business, can seldom or never rise to independence. This is the case all over the country, but especially in California, where capital is so abundant and grasping, and competition so bold and calculating. In the past, no doubt, fortunes were suddenly and, perhaps, easily made in California; but now, in the present state of affairs, to acquire, not to say a fortune, but even to get a living requires the exercise of ability of no ordinary character.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="CHAPTER XXVIII.">
        <p>THE IRISH RACE IN OREGON, NEVADA, WASHINGTON TERRI-TORY AND IDAHO.</p>
        <p>Oregon is, as a State, next in importance to California, though less in area than Nevada, Montana, Arizona or British Columbia. It is on account of its agricultural resources, which are in the commencement of their development, as well as by reason of its interesting historical reminiscences, that Oregon derives its importance.</p>
        <p>The area of the State, is about 95,000 square miles, and lies with the degrees of 42 and 46.20 of northern latitude, and, though Captain Gray took possession of the country as early as 1792, yet it was not admitted as a State until 1859.</p>
        <p>The Spaniards and the French undoubtedly visited the coasts at an earlier date, and imposed a name on the country, as they did on California, the origin of which name, like the latter, remains in doubt up to the present time, which sufficiently indicates a marked indifference to antiquarian literature of the first explorers of those regions.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 499" />The name "Oregon" was probably given by the Spaniards, who called the Indians "Orizon," from the manner in which they stretched the lobes of their ears, as the French called a cognate tribe "Pend'oreilles." But this account is as unreliable as the derivation of California, which some assert to be of Latin, derivation, as "Calida fornix," some of Spanish, as "Colophonia," the name for pitch, and some assert is an Indian word, while others call it Greek. It is most probable, however, that California signifies "the land of flowers," caught from an exclamation of an Italian sailor, "Quali fiori"--" O, what flowers."Be this as it may, it is certain that Oregon is a fertile and very productive State, containing lands, timber, minerals and water power which cannot be equaled in the Union; and in fifty years from now she will probably be the Empire State of the Pacific slope. To give a minute geographical account of this young member of the confederacy does not come within the scope of this work. We have undertaken only to give an account of the leading men of our race in that promising young republic.</p>
        <p>The population of the entire State is not over 150,000, and some of the earliest settlers were Irishmen. Portland is the metropolis, and some 
        <pb n="500 The Irish Race in California." />of the pioneers were, for instance, Rev. Mr. McCormac and his brother, H. I., proprietor of the Catholic Sentinel. In all branches of business our people are well represented, such as E. Martin &amp; Co., wholesale merchants; E. A. Cronin, Esq., attorney-at-law; Jas. Dolan, U. S. Hotel; J. M. Gearin, Esq., Ellis Read, banker; Dr. McBride, O'Connor &amp; Malorky, Patrick Norton, E. O'Neil,* etc.</p>
        <p>Astoria, twelve miles from the mouth of the Columbia River, was established in 1811, by an expedition sent out by Jacob Astor, of New York.</p>
        <p>Lewis and Clarke visited the site of Astoria in 1805. Some of the earliest settlers were Irish, such as Colonel McClure, an Ulster man, Mr. Ireland, Gallagher, McGuire, McEwen, Corbet, and others.</p>
        <p>One of the most prominent settlers of the Territory, was Dr. McLoughlin, who game at an early day to 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 501" />the Pacific Coast. He became soon after his arrival, probably in 1820 or 1821, the first clerk of the Hudson Bay Company. He subsequently became the Governor of that celebrated corporation, and continued at the head of its affairs for about twenty years, when he resigned under a full pension from the company he so faithfully served. He was of Irish birth or descent, and was educated in in [sic] Canada. He came to Oregon City about the year 1835, where he settled down and married the widow of Thomas McCay, Esq., who was a full-blooded Indian, but well educated, and a woman of marked ability. This woman was the mother of several children, first with McCay, and again with her next husband, McLoughlin. One of Dr. McLoughlin's daughters became a Mrs. Harvey, and his son David is a resident of Colville, Oregon, and the inheritor of a large share of his father's great wealth.</p>
        <p>Of his five children only three survive. His daughter, Mrs. Harvey, who now resides in Portland, and another who resides in Canada. Mr. McLoughlin's wealth was derived, first, from his large share of stock in the Hudson Bay Company, and next from his speculations in lands. When he came to Oregon City the site of that flourishing town was but a desert, but he purchased a 
        <pb n="502 The Irish Race in California." />large tract of land there, judging rightly that it would become a city in time, and laid out a town on paper which soon realized his anticipations. He built a flour mill and saw mill and established a large store, which supplied the whole country for hundreds of miles with supplies. He died in 1856, full of years--eighty-three---and honors, having bequeathed besides his lands, about $175,000 to each of his three children. He was a man of large mind and liberal views in civil affairs, but very strict in his religious convictions. He was called the father of the colony in and around Oregon City, and the entire inhabitants mourned at his death as children are wont to do at the death of a father.</p>
        <p>There are other men of not so much note but of of [sic] no less merit in Oregon and the adjacent territories. Such is Mr. Cosgrove, a native of Dublin, a prominent citizen of Portland, and an early settler. The farming interest is well represented by another Mr. Cosgrove, who resides in Willamette Valley, as also by a Mr. Hayes and his three sons, who own and cultivate large farms. Mr. John Reardon, of Idaho City, with his seven sons, is a leading man, and came in at an early date.[sic] while John Murphy, Esq., a land surveyor, also a pioneer and a man of cultivated mind, took an 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 503" />important part in the settlement of the country. Edward Fitzgerald, a Leinster man, probably connected with the Geraldines, came to Oregon at an early date of its settlement. His wife is a niece of Cardinal Cullen, and they have resided for many years at the "Dalles."Mr. Fitzgerald is engaged in merchandise, extensively. Maurice Fitzgerald, a brother to Edward, is settled in Walla Walla, engaged in merchandise. He was a commissioned officer in the United States army for several years, and retired with a high reputation for gallantry and discipline.</p>
        <p>Judge Matthew P. Deady is as Irish as can be, though the writer of his biography in the "Representative Men of the Pacific," makes him of English extraction, as well as Irish. He learned and followed the trade of blacksmithing, which was no disgrace to him, for we read in Plato, that it was recommendable for every philosopher to know some art. From the anvil and its music, he passed into studying the intricacies of the law, to the practice of which he was admitted in 1847.</p>
        <p>In '49 he came with a Government train to Oregon, where he was again obliged, owing to straightened circumstances, to teach school.</p>
        <p>In 1850 he resumed the practice of law. He was then elected to the Legislature, where he dis- 
        <pb n="504 The Irish Race in California." />tinguished himself for sound views and practical suggestions. He was appointed judge in 1853.</p>
        <p>His reputation while judge was such, that all parties were loud in his praise. He became president of the convention to form a State Government, in 1857, and had much to do with forming the State Constitution. He soon after was appointed justice of the United States District Court. He was appointed to a most important work by the Governor, in 1864, namely, to codify the laws of Oregon.</p>
        <p>Such was the opinion of Judge Deady's judicial integrity that he was appointed to try a case arising out of the arbitrary imprisonment of a citizen, Mr. McCall, by the United States officers of San Francisco, and Judge Deady's decision was against the authors of the arbitrary arrest and in favor of the liberty of the citizen.</p>
        <p>Judge Deady, who may be called a self-made man, resides in Oregon City, and stands as high among his neighbors for benevolence and virtue as he does in the history of the coast for judicial integrity and sterling worth.</p>
        <p>THE STATE OF NEVADA, situated southeast of California, stands next to the latter in mineral resources. The area is about 120,000 square miles and the population about 75,000. The agricultural re- 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 505" />sources of this State are not much developed, owing to the prominence given to silver and gold mining, some of the most productive mines on the continent, such as "the Comstocks," being located at Virginia City, in that State.</p>
        <p>Several of the first explorers of that State and most successful "prospectors" were Irishmen, and the "Irish element" controls the richest mines of that State at present.</p>
        <p>At the head of these stand Mackay &amp; Fair, O'Connor, Lynch, Kelly, Hughes, McCarthy, editor Evening Chronicle, James H. Ryan, lawyers John McQuaid, G. McConnie, and many other leading men of Our race in Virginia City.</p>
        <p>The villages of the State, which were originally mining camps, are numerous, with a population varying according to the success of the explorations for rich developments. Places like Pioche, which during several years had a population of thousands, are reduced, by the failure to find paying ore, to a few scores of inhabitants, within three months. And should the mines become exhausted or the working of them be interrupted by nature, such as an earthquake, it is probable that the seventy thousand population of that State at present, would be reduced to seven thousand, in a very short time. This much must be said in favor 
        <pb n="506 The Irish Race in California." />of the capitalists of Nevada, that they pay the men in their employment good wages, averaging not much less than four dollars a day. Hence, though many are out of employment, the working men have better times than in any section of the Union. We attribute this in a great measure to the liberality of the great capitalists and miners, who employ only white men and pay good wages.</p>
        <p>If we contrast the conduct of our great mining capitalists with the grasping railroad corporation, that aims at ruling the State and degrading the white man by reducing his wages to one dollar a day, less than they pay coolies, we will see who the oppressors of the poor, and the instigators of riots are!</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON TERRITORY lies north of Oregon, west of Idaho, and extends westward to the Pacific Ocean. Its area is 70,000 square miles, and it has a population of about 40,000 people. Olympia is the capital, and two of the State officers--J. M. Murphy and E. T. Gun--are respectively Auditor and Treasurer of the State. The third Governor was Mr. McGill, now of the Hibernia Savings Bank, of this city.</p>
        <p>Of the Federal State officers, also, Kearney, McMeeken and Johnson are Irish-Americans, and McFadden, delegate to Congress.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 507" />Washington Territory, though lying between latitude 45 and 49, is of a mild climate, and abounds in all the resources of a great State. It is well timbered, has magnificent rivers, bays and water-power, and minerals, such as coal, copper and the precious metals.</p>
        <p>We find printers and publishers and editors of our race predominant, such as J. M. Murphy, of the Washington Standard; M. H. Mooney &amp; Bro., of the Kalama Beacon; A. J. Cain, of the Dayton News; E. T. Green, of the Transcript&lt;/priodicalTitle&gt;; James Power, of the Bellingham Bay Mail, and David Higgins, of the Seattle Intelligencer.</p>
        <p>Leary &amp; McCloud, attorneys; the Talbot Coal Company, under direction of John Collins; the Kelly Brothers, Lynch Brothers, and J. S. Lyon. In fact, our race has more than an average representation in this young and promising territory, which, in the course of time, cannot fail to command a leading influence in its government and prosperity.</p>
        <p>IDAHO TERRITORY, organized in 1863, is situated East of Washington territory, and occupies a space irregularly shaped, from the 42d to the 49th parallel, with an area of about 100,000 square miles, and a population of 35,000 souls. The climate is healthy and dry, and in the great valleys, such as 
        <pb n="508 The Irish Race in California." />the Weiser and Bruneau, the land is arable and productive.</p>
        <p>Boise City is the principal place in the Territory, and here our people are represented by Hon. Jno. Ward, a man of distinction, who was among the first who settled in that region.</p>
        <p>Pat McMahon, of Idaho, one of the most indefatigable miners in the West, has risen by the honest industry of labor, to competence and wealth. He has reared and educated six children, all well-to-do in the world. His brother, John McMahon, is also a practical miner, and a very successful one.</p>
        <p>John O'Farrell, is also a pioneer and capitalist of Boise City. John Early, Flannagan brothers, M. Kelly, editor of the Idaho Statesman; Smith &amp; Kelly, attorneys; James Griffin, D. T. Cahalon--all men of prominence.</p>
        <p>Indeed Idaho offers many advantages to immigrants in search of homes, the lands being obtainable at Government prices and fertile, and mining being as yet in its infancy. The only drawback on immigration is the difficulty of reaching the country, which must be approached via Portland, Oregon, or by stage, over two hundred miles from Battle Mountain, on the Central Pacific Railroad.</p>
        <p>In all the different stations or camps, such as 
        <pb n="The Irish Race in California. 509" />Fairnew, Owyhee County, we find a good representation of our people, such as Brown, Dorsey, Frazer, McAuliff, Collins, McCreary, etc., and at Idaho City, Corkeran, Dunigan, Barry, Bennett, McDevitt, etc. McGuires, Cuddys, Rileys, Dohertys, Reardons, Nash and others, are doing business in the remote villages of the Territory. In fact, a fair percentage of the merchants, and fully one-half of the miners are of Irish descent or birth in Idaho, where there could be a population of many millions, with proper facilities to transport immigrants thither.</p>

        <pb n="[511]" />In the following pages is a list of Irish names, ancient and modern. The list is by no means perfect, nor does it include all Irish names, but only a few of the common and popular families, when and where they flourished, and what changes took place in the orthography and pronunciation of those family names. The author does not undertake to give the pedigrees of those families he introduces, nor even the origin and derivation of their names; for to perform such a work would take a large volume, and this has been accomplished by well known Celtic authors, such as McFerbis, O'Clerys and others. Instead of giving the derivation of the name McNamara, for instance--a word originally spelled "Cu-mara," and signifying "sea-dogs "--from the distinction that family obtained as seamen and navigators--we give merely the date in which they flourished, the possessions they owned as princes and chieftains, and the localities 
        <pb n="512 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />in which their descendants exist up to the present time.</p>
        <p>Most of the old Irish family names had a very poetic origin. For instance, the name Loughlin, from "Loch-lannach," is composed of two Irish words--" Loch," sea, or a large body of water, and "lann," brave or skillful; that is, men who were brave navigators--a name imposed on the first Scandinavian pirates or Danes. So that though both Cu-mara or McNamara and Loughlin have the same origin in idea, namely, bold navigators, yet the words used to express this idea are different, from the wonderful poetic fertility of the Celtic tongue. There are many old Irish names which have lost their meanings and euphony by ridiculous translations; for instance, the numerous Smith family were originally "Gobhan" or "Gowan." The name Wynne is a translation of "Mulgauthe" or "Mulgeha "--servant of the wind. The first change was to "Wind," but this appearing too blowy, they altered it to "Wynne." So, "Early" is a translation of "Mulmogherty," or son of the dawn, and wolf is a translation of "Mactire," the Irish for wolf. But even where there is no vulgar translation, the changes of the modern from the old Celtic are remarkable. Thus, the first of the Kavanaghs had that name imposed on him from 
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 513" />"Caemhanach," or one brought up at "Cil Caemhain," or Kilcavan, near Gorey, Wexford, where the young prince was fostered. Who now would suspect that the word Kavanagh is synonymous with the words "brought up at St. Kevins," except those alone who have a knowledge of that most ancient, flexible and musical of all languages, namely, the Celtic.</p>

        <p>Moriarty, Muircheartagh; this is a very ancient name. One was a king, and began his reign in 504. The Moriartys were in high rank, both in the North and South. Murchertagh, son of Niul Glunduff, or the Blackneed, was King of Innis Owen.</p>
        <p>Murphy, Murchada; it was recorded that Donnell O'Murphy, Chief of Hy-Felimy, was killed by the Hy-kensellas, in 1382. This Hy-Felimy, was in Wexford, in the Barony of Ballaghkeen. The Murphys were descended from Felimy, Son of Enna Kinsella, King of Leinster, in the 5th century. The head of the Murphy family lived at Toberlimnich, in the Murroes, in 1634. His name was Connel Murphy, the son of Art, who was son of Donnel More, who was son of Teigue, or Tim Murphy, called The O'Murphy, chief of the name. There was another branch of the same family, at a place called Oulartleigh, in the 16th century. A poet, O'Heerin, wrote the following of the Murphys: "A lordship of heavy 
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 525" />profit, O'Murphy, of the smooth bright land, obtained the territory of Hy-Felimy, in the partition of the possessions of his ancestors". This family is represented in a direct line, at present, by the Murphys of San Jose; the late Timothy Murphy of San Rafael, was of the McMurragh, in a direct line. There are several other distinguished descendants of the Murphys in the State, as many as six or more of them in the Legislature, one City, or Prosecuting Attorney, of this city, Daniel Murphy, and several surgeons, as Jas. Murphy, M. D., Clay street, Murphy, Grant &amp; Co., and others of high standing in the community. The Hon. Member of the Assembly from Del Norte, is a talented and leading representative of that famous old family.</p>
        <p>N.</p>
        <p>Neylan, Niallain; was a family of note. In the 9th century one of the name was Bishop of Slane. Another venerable member of that name, Shane oge O'Nialain, was Bishop of Kilfenora, in Clare, in the 16th century. In 1093, both the Annals of Ulster and those of the Four Masters&lt;/bootkTitle&gt; record the death of Ailell O'Niallian, corb of Sts. Kieran and Cronan and Abbot of Cluan Macnoise. The Nialans had possessions in Temple Malley, Barony of Bunratty, Clare.</p>
        <p>Nunan, Noenan; a very ancient name of unquestionable Milesian origin. They were of the order of olaves, poets and brehons in the pre-Christian ages, and had possessions in Thomond. The traits of the ancient stock have been retained by the modern Nunans in Clare and Limerick. Hon. Ed. Nunan and Sheriff Matthew Nunan worthily represent the name in this city.</p>
        <p>O.</p>
        <p>O'Beirne, Ua Birn; these were chiefs of Tirbruin, and lords of Ballyclare, County Roscommon. The O'Beirnes country was in the East of Roscommon, near Lough Broderig, on the river Shannon.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="526 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />O'Bardon, Ui Barduin; the name of a celebrated harper in Connaught. James Bardon, of Superior, Wis., worthily represents that old name.</p>
        <p>O'Banan, Ui Bonain; a name of a sept in Dalaridia in the North. The author Banim, the celebrated novelist was of that family.</p>
        <p>O'Boyle, Ui Baoghill; some of this name were chiefs of Cloghineely in Tirconnell, as also in Ter-ainmeragh, now called Boylagh, Donegal.</p>
        <p>O'Branan, Ui Branain; were from Perry, and were distinguished in Doire Maelan, now Derryallen, near Lough Erne, Fermanagh.</p>
        <p>O'Brislin, Ua Breislein; chiefs of Fanad Tirconnell, in Ulster, from the 10th century.</p>
        <p>O'Brien; is one of the most illustrious in the annals of Erin. They were monarchs, kings, princes and chiefs in Ireland. The O'Briens were from different sections in Ireland, but Thomond was the original inheritance of the most illustrious race of the O'Briens. Brian Borumba, or Boru, from being a petty king of the Dalcassians, became Ardrigh, after having deposed Maelshaughlin in 1002. He crushed the Danish pirates at Clontarf and, though he lost his life, he left his country independent. Turlough O'Brien, his grandson, succeeded him as monarch, and, though the O'Briens lost the supreme sovereignty, yet, as kings of Munster and Thomond, their power lasted for centuries. Lord Inchiquin, of Dromoland, in Clare, represents the old kingly race, as did Smith O'Brien, his brother, and, in this city, McMahon, John and Thomas O'Brien have unquestionably the most direct descent from the O'Briens of Thomond, and, consequently, of Brian Boru.</p>
        <p>O'Byrnes, Ui Brain; were lords of Hy Kinsella. They were powerful chiefs in Wicklow, and had a castle at Glenmalure. Their country was called Criogh Branagh. This tribe derived their origin from Cahir More, King of Ireland in the 11th century. Indeed, their pedigree is traced for twenty generations, and they were always loyal to Ireland.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 527" />O'Callaghan, Ua Ceallachain; this family gave provincial kings to Cashel and chiefs to other territories. Muinter O'Callaghan were very numerous in Cork, especially in Cloyne and Ross, and have many representatives here.</p>
        <p>O'Carolan, Ua Cearbhallain; distinguished for learning and poetry, in the counties of Perry and Tyrone. The celebrated musician, Carolan, was of this tribe.</p>
        <p>O'Carrol, Ui Cearbhaill; were Lords of Ely O'Carroll, King's County, in Munster, and of Oirghialla, or Oriel, in Ulster. In fact, the family was among the most distinguished in Ireland for several centuries, and even here, in the new worlds, the ancient glory of the name was revived in Charles, Carrol of Carolton. They were descended of Oiliol Olum, King of Ireland.</p>
        <p>O'Cassidys, Ua Caisside; were hereditary physicians, poets, or olaves to the Maguires of Fermanagh.</p>
        <p>O'Ceileher, or Keleher; were an old sept in Saiger, or Seirkieran, in Eily O'Carroll, in Leinster, from which they spread into Cork and Kerry.</p>
        <p>O'Clery, Ua Clerig; were descended from Guaire Aidne, King of Connaught, in the 7th century. Hy-Fiacragh Aidne, comprises the present diocese of Kilmacduagh. But the O'Clerys were driven from their hereditary possessions by the De Burgos, soon after the English invasion. Some of the exiled family settled in Kilkenny, some in Befny O'Reilly (Cavan), and some in Tirawley. The Four Masters were, three of them, O'Clerys, and one O'Mulconry. Teige O'Clery of the Mountain (in religion Brother Michael) was chief of the Four Masters, Conary O'Clery the second, and Cugory the third. Teigue au Sleibe, or Timothy of the Mountain, took the name Michael in religion, of the Franciscan Order. He refused orders, as St. Francis himself did, through scruples of conscience, and had he become a priest probably we should never have had the Annals of Ireland--the greatest work ever written, and the most impartial regarding the history of any nation on earth. Conary O'Clery was the scribe, or amanuensis, of his brother Michael; he was a layman.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="528 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />Cugory, or Peregrine O'Cleary, was the next annalist to Michael in importance. He wrote, also, the life of the glorious Hugh Roe O'Donnell, who conquered the English at Donaveera. Cugory owned the lands of Coobeg, in Donegal, of which he was dispossessed, and his lands forfeited to the king, because he was a mere Irishman. Of O'Mulconry nothing is known but that he was an antiquarian, and a native of Roscommon. Not one of them was a priest. Such were the celebrated Quatuor Magistri, or Four Masters.</p>
        <p>O'Connells, O'Counell; were descended from King Oilioll Ollum. They were numerous in Kerry and Clare. Cromwell sent several families of this name into Clare, the leading representatives of which were O'Connell, of Kilgory, near Tulla, and Charles O'Connell, of Ennis. The illustrious Daniel O'Connell, of Kerry, the Liberator of his country, the wisest and most successful Irishman since the English invasion, restores the name of O'Connell to the highest celebrity. He laid down a new principle in seeking for political redress, namely, that peaceful and legal means are better than forcible or warlike efforts. All civilized people are gradually adopting these great principles of O'Connell.</p>
        <p>O'Connerys, Ui Conaire; were olaves and literati at an early age in Desmond. One of this family is chief editor of the New York Herald.</p>
        <p>O'Connor, O'Conchobhair (pronounced Conoir); is an illustrious Irish name. They came directly in a line from Ir. One of the name was the last Monarch of Erin, Roderic by name. There were other branches of the name, and even descended from different origins, such as The Heremonian O'Connors, The O'Connor Kerry, The O'Connor Sligo, O'Connor Faly, O'Connor Don or gray, and O'Connor Roe or red. These families were not always faithful to Ireland, and hence the Connaught branch of them have retained their hereditary estates. In every profession and path of life this name has been distinguished. In New York Charles O'Conor, and in California, at San Rafael, Michael O'Connor, and in this city P. J O'Connor, architect, and Cornelius O'Connor, support 
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 529" />the dignity of this old royal name. The pedigree of The O'Connors Sligo is given in full in McForbis and the Annals of Four Masters.</p>
        <p>O'Corkerans, Ua Corcrain; learned men, and Bishops in Connaught and Leinster, near Carlow, in the 10th century. Another branch of them were Chiefs in Queen's County, and in Desmond. William Corkeran, architect, represents them here.</p>
        <p>O'Corrys, or Currys, Ua Corra; an ancient Sept in Dalcas. The late Eugene Corry was the direct representative of that family, and a native of Clare. Another branch of that name, from Ulster, is represented by the Curry brothers, of Sansome street.</p>
        <p>O'Cullens, Ua Cuilleen; were of an old family, many of whom were saints and ecclesiastics. There was the great Monastery of Kilcullen, in Kildare, which hands down the name, which was also very common in Carlow, and in Limerick. The learned Cardinal of Dublin is the most distinguished of this name to-day, and Father Cullen, of this city.</p>
        <p>O'Devines, Ua Daimhain; were Lords of Hymany, in Connaught, and also in Fermanagh, in the barony of Tirkennedy. John Devine, of San Jose, represents that name.</p>
        <p>O'Dalys, Ua Dalaigh; were hereditary olaves and poets of the Chiefs, Kings, and Princes of Erin, from a very early date.</p>
        <p>O'Den, Ua Dain; an old family, who had possession in Lower Ormond, Dunmineer, in the County of Tipperary. Dr. Den, of Los Angeles, represents that name in this State.</p>
        <p>O'Deas, O'Deadhagdh; were an old family in the Barony of Inchquin, Clare, where there is a township called Fany O'Dea, from its ancient owners.</p>
        <p>O'Dempseys, O'Dimasaigh; the O'Dempsys were a great clan in their own O'Dempsey country, which comprised a large space on both sides of the River Barrow, in the King's and Queen's County. They were of the Clan Moilurga, or Clanmalier. The Barony of Philipstown, in Kings, and Portnah- 
        <pb n="530 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />ing, in Queen's County, were the original possessions of the O'Dempseys, but they obtained, also, possessions of Lee Castle, Cuslaun Leige, and other eight townships in South Glanmaliry.</p>
        <p>O'Dohertys, Ua Dochartagh; were of the Kinel Conel, and powerful Chiefs of Inishowen, Ardmire, and Tirenda, in Tyrconnell, the latter situated between the rivers Foyle and Swilly, in Donegal. Ardmire was West of Tir-Enda, near Logh Finn. The O'Dohertys being of the Kind Conel race, expelled the Kinelowen tributary to O'Neil, and thus became Lords of Innisowen, and were tributary to the O'Donnells. In this city they are represented by P. J. Doherty, Esq., nephew of Peter Dohahue, and Mr. Doherty, of Oakland, a pioneer of Alameda. The pedigree of the O'Dohertys, is traced back to Niul, of the nine hostages, from whom they were descended by twenty-seven generations, up to Conor an Einagh, who died in 1413.</p>
        <p>O'Donahoes, Ua Dunchada; there were two branches of this celebrated family. The one were Lords of Cashel, in Munster, and the other in Monaghan. They were of the race Eagan-Mor, eldest son of Oilill Olum, King of Munster, in the 2d century. The Donahoes were also Chiefs of Hy Carmac, in Moinmoy, included in Hymany. The O'Donaghoe of Kerry, represents the southern branch of the family in a direct line, while the Ulster and Leinster branches, are represented by Colonel Peter Donahue, and James Donahoe, of this city.</p>
        <p>O'Donnels, O'Domhnail; were the most illustrious of Ireland's princes, kings, and heroes. When exhausted, betrayed, and plundered of their royal patrimony, they became exiles, and added lustre to the fame and glory of foreign lands, by their genius and bravery. Austria, Spain, France, and other continental nations adopted the exiled Princes of Tyr-Connell, and to this day their descendants exercise the highest offices in these, their adopted countries, and there are several of the name in this city.</p>
        <p>O'Donovans, O'Donobhain; were a very ancient and distin- 
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 531" />guished clan. One of them, Cathal, fought at Clontarf in 1013. The O'D's, like the O'Brien's and McCarthys, were descended from Eagan Iaidhleagh, or Eagan the Splendid, otherwise called Mogh Nuadhat, who flourished in the 2nd century. This Moght Nuadhat was driven from Ireland by Con of the hundred battles. He went to Spain and got married to the king's daughter, Beara, and soon after returned to Ireland with a Spanish army, with which he defeated Con and compelled him to yield him the sovereignty of one half of Ireland, called Leach Moght, while Con had the other half, Leath Cuin. Bear Haven, where the invader landed, was called after his Spanish wife, Beara. This Moght was the father of Oilell Olum. From him descended all the great families of Munster: O'Carrols, O'Meaghers, McCarthys, the O'Connels, O'Donoghoes, Kennedys, O'Mahonys, O'Sullivans, etc. (See Appendix of the Four Masters for full pedigree of this name).</p>
        <p>O'Dowds, O'Dubhda; were chiefs of Tirawley, in County Mayo, and also of Tireragh in same County in the 10th century.</p>

        <p>O'Farrells, Ua Fearghail; were great chiefs in Annally, Longford, and Kings of Tullyoge, in Tyrone. The name is sometimes, and correctly spelled Ferral, which is the form in which Judge Ferral, of this city, uses. Farley is but a corruption of this name. The new United States Senator-elect, from California, is of that name, which he imagines is of Scotch origin.</p>
        <p>O'Flaherty, O'Flaihheartaigh, also Lavertys; were Chiefs of West Connaught, from the 10th to the 16th century.</p>
        <p>O'Flynn, Ua Floinn; were Lords of Ui Tuotha, the ancient name of a territory in Antrim, East of Lough Neagh. Five or six parishes were comprised in the territory.

The O'Hanlys owned five or six parishes in Roscommon, along the Shannon, from Carnadae bridge to Drumdaff.

        <p>O'Slavens, O'Sleibhin; were poets and physicians in Oirgalla, or Oriel, in Ulster. Slaven, in Baldwin block, Market street, well represents this honored name in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>O'Sullivans, O'Suileabhain; were a very illustrious race of the remotest origin. O'Sullivan Beare, who had his castle at Bear Haven, was one of the bravest men that Ireland ever produced. When betrayed by the Spaniard, Don Juan 
        <pb n="538 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />d'Avila, in 1602, his castle, Dunboy, being taken, after the death of the heroic McGeoghegan, he retreated with one thousand men and much cattle to the mountains, pursued by the Anglo-Irish army, the Barrys, McCarthys, O'Briens, Donovans, and other traitors, including his own uncle. He finally retreated through Limerick and Tipperary, till they crossed the Shannon at Portlane, on "curraghs," or boats formed of the hides of their slaughtered horses. When they arrived in Galway, at O'Rourk's Castle, they had only thirty-five men left out of the thousand. After that O'Sullivan went to Spain, where he got a royal pension from Philip III., but was murdered, in 1616, by John Bath, an Englishman. Con. O'Sullivan, of this city, is of this noble stock, and most likely John Sullivan, Esq., capitalist, of this city, also.</p>
        <p>O'Toland or O'Tuolin, Ua Tuathalain; an old Irish name, borne by men in this city who would ignore their origin.</p>
        <p>O'Tomaltys, O'Tomaltagh; were chiefs in Ulster and famous in Irish history for valor and hospitality, even before the Christian era. They were kings of Ulster and lords of Magh Aei, in Meath. Mr. Tomalty, of Sixth street, represents that old sept.</p>

The O'Tooles, O'Byrnes and MacMurroughs had the same ancestry, that was, Breasal Bealogh, father of Enna, father of Dunlang, father of Oiliol, and so on up to Saint Laurence, 1180. Their pedegree [sic] is perfect up from the 2nd century to the present. The O'Tooles of Santa Clara County are lineal descendants of those O'Tooles who owned land near Castle Talbot, Wexford.</p>
        <p>P.</p>
        <p>Power, Peoragh; was a noble family, which came over with the English invasion. Their descendants are now numerous in Waterford, and in other parts of Ireland. Father P. Power, of Sutter Creek, represents the name.</p>
        <p>Purcels, Purchealagh; were another English family, members 
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 539" />of which became patriotic. One of the family, Sir Hugo, founded a monastry [sic] at Waterford, in 1240.</p>
        <p>Petits; were of English origin, and had possessions near Mullingar, Westmeath, in the 14th century. They are now numerous in Wexford.</p>

        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Quigley, or O'Coigley, O'Cugale; were a sept in Donegal, near Lough Swilly, and also in Fermanagh. One of the name was abbot of Louth, early in the 8th century. The people of a large district in Donegal, are almost all of this name, and there are two localities, Quigley's Point and Carrig O'Quigley, called after them. An obscure anonymous writer, in answer to a correspondent in an Eastern paper, gave it as his opinion, that the name was not remarkable for having achieved anything in history, whereas, the very derivation of the name, from Cu-Ulad, or the wolf-dog of Ulster, would indicate the reverse of what the said paid scribe asserts. There was a bishop of the name in the last century, in Galway, and the Rev. James Quigley, executed in Maidstone, Kent, in '98, for patriotism, adds a halo of glory to the name. Father Quigley was arrested in company with Arther O'Connor and Mr. Binns, on his way to supplicate the French Directory for aid, and it is suspected was betrayed by the latter, Binns. He and O'Connor being pardoned, while no mercy was shown to the priest patriot. The lying newspapers of the day, gave it out that Dr. Quigley tried to commit suicide, but at the moment before his execution, he took a sharp penknife from his pocket, and peeled an apple with it, to prove to the spectators, that if he intended to take his life, he could do so. Dan Quigley, of Verona street, represents this name. Some of the relatives of Dr. James 
        <pb n="540 Irish Names, Ancient and Modern." />Quigley, executed in Maidstone, June 8th, 1798, were obliged to change their names to Fivey, to avoid the confiscation of their estates.</p>

        <p>Stanleys; English lords, who were high in office in Ireland, soon after the conquest in 1234.</p>
        <p>Stantons; were also Norman, and had a castle in Dunamon on the River Suck, between Galway and Roscommon.</p>
        <p>Sweeney. (See MacSweeny, and O'Sweeney.)T.</p>
        <p>Talbots; English noblemen, were in high authority from the the [sic] time of the English invasion. They remain still at Malahide, near Dublin.</p>
        <p>Tobins, Tobinigh; were of English origin, and numerous within the pale, at Leinster. In 1433 Walter Tobin was a great warrior. This old Norman name derived from St. Aubin, is represented in this city by Richard and Robert Tobin, capitalists, and J. Tobin, of Pine street.</p>
        <p>Tyrrels, Thryal; were of the English colony, near Mullingar, West Meath; the chief families of which were the Daltons, Petits, Tuites, and Darcys. They had frequent conflicts with the natives, backed by their English allies.</p>

        <p>V.</p>
        <p>Vaughan; a name of Norman origin, which became naturalized in Ireland soon after the English invasion. There were distinguished statesmen and soldiers of the name. Mr.</p>
        <p>
        <pb n="Irish Names, Ancient and Modern. 541" />Vaughan, of 18 Third street, this city, represents the leading branch of that family.</p>
        <p>W.</p>
        <p>Wolf; a translation from Mactire and McEntire. Mr. Wolf, the druggist of San Rafael, worthily represents this name. He is a native of Kerry, and respectably descended.</p>
        <p>Wynne; a translation from Mulgeha, which signifies Servant of the Wind. Mr. Wynne, of 706 Market street, represents this now euphonious name.</p>
        <p>Ward, or Mc An Baird; sons of the poet, is a very old Celtic name. P. Ward, of Minna street, is a worthy scion of that old name.</p>
        <p>Having omitted a notice of John Manning, Esq., late editor of the Ballarat Times, in Australia, and later of the New Zealand Celt, we supply the omission in this place by stating that Mr. Manning, after having suffered imprisonment and persecution in Australia on account of his patriotism, and having been sentenced to penal servitude for life, was obliged to quit that region and come under protection of the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Manning has been a continual contributor to the Overland Monthly and other leading journals. He is an elegant and ready writer, and his style and vigor of composition have been compared to those of John Mitchell. He is now in this city and preparing a work on Australia.</p>
